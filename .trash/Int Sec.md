## 1 Internal Security

- **Internal Security** - Ministry of Home Affairs - Security of a country from within its borders. Upholding sovereignty, and maintenance of peace, law & order within the country. 

- **External Security** -  Defence Ministry - Security of a country from external aggression by another country or foreign elements. 

#### Kautilya Arthshahstra - 4 Types of Threats 
1. Internal - Linguistic riots, Communalism, Ethnic-Caste based violence, Naxalism
2. External - Indo-China War, Foreign Intelligence activities
3. Internally aided External - Support given by some extremist and separatist organisations within the country to foreign nations to destabilise their own country
4. Externally aided Internal - ISI backed JK Militancy
Security perception is a generous mix of all the 4 types

#### Failure on security fronts leads to
1. Loss of sovereignty
2. Disintegration
3. Civil Wars
4. Military Coups
5. Widespread Violence
6. Breakdown of Constitutional Machinery

### Attributes (Requirements) of Int Sec 
1. Secure & protect territorial integrity & internal sovereignty
2. Maintain domestic peace
3. Uphold Law & Order
4. Peaceful co-existence and Communal Harmony
5. Absence of Fear

#### Major Challenges to Int Sec
1. Hinterland Terrorism - Domestic & International
2. J&K Militancy Terrorism
3. NE Insurgency
4. Left Wing Extremism - Naxalism
5. Organised Crime & its nexus with Terrorism
6. Communalism -  Religious fault lines
7. Caste - Ethnic tensions
8. Regionalism & Inter-state disputed - Linguistic riots
9. Border Management
10. Coastal Security
11. Cyber Security
12. Threats due to terrorism, narcotics and drugs, small arms proliferation, voids in energy requirement and information warfare loon large on the horizon

### Root causes - Factors for Int Sec problems
1. Partition related inherited problems
	1. Unfriendly neighbours
	2. Poverty & Unemployment
2. Administrative failures
	1. Inequitable growth
	2. Wealth & Opportunity gap
	3. Governance deficit - Maladministration
3. Partisan Politics
	1. Rising Communalism
	2. Increased Caste awareness & caste tensions
	3. Identity Politics (+ Sectorial Identities) based on divisive criteria
	4. Separatist tendencies
4. Other factors
	1. Porous Borders
	2. Corruption
	3. Poor Criminal Justice System
	4. Nexus between criminals - politicians - Police
	5. Inter-state disputed over boundary and natural resources can lead to violent flares and harm the unity & federal structure of the nation

### Key Elements of Int Sec Doctrine
1. Political - Analyse the nature and causative factors and check whether the demands are within the Constitutional framework.
	1. Secessionist Movements - Needs to be curbed with a heavy hand
	2. Separatists Movements - Kept at a safe distance
	3. Regional & Ethnic aspirations - Reasonably softer and sympathetic approach
2. Socio-Economic - Genuine socio-economic grievances arise from shortage of resources, poverty-unemployment, displacement. The connected issues should be addressed to ensure equitable growth and development with no regional disparities
3. Governance - Anti-establishment elements ride on the corruption, mismanagement, poor implementation of laws and absence of government machinery in remote areas. It is the duty of state to control corruption and provide good governance on civil and police sides
4. Security Forces - Police - Police & military atrocities and indifference often aggravate the grievances and raises the security problems, #Eg AFSPA. Police needs to be sensitised and be more citizen friendly. Central forces should also understand the local context and situations and maintain highest order of efficiency while being transparent, professional and neutral
5. Centre State Coordination - Problem exists in all areas ranging from intelligence to operations. Institutional frameworks needs to be prepared to resolve the problem and brig in synergies at all levels
6. Intelligence, a major component - Defensive & Offensive intelligence is required to forewarn and neutralise the threats. Regular institutional framework is required to compile, collate and act on intelligence inputs 
7. Border Management - Effective guarding of land and coastal borders is the key to a safer country. Illegal immigration, infiltration, smuggling drugs-cattle-arms, etc are the rampant problems
8. Cyber Security - Cyberspace will be a theatre of warfare. Snowden Wikileaks, 2013 reveal that future wars will not be traditional wars fought on land, water or air

### Measures to strengthen IntSec
1. Stringent laws (& its implementation) against Communal hatred and propaganda 
2. Comprehensive policy to curb black money 
3. Targeted approach for Poverty alleviation
4. Police Reforms
5. Regulation on Social Media
6. Comprehensive strategy to tackle Naxalism
7. National Counter Terrorism Centre NCTC
8. Reforms in CAPF, CRPF
9. Border Management
10. National Cyber Security Policy, 2020


### External Security Challenges - 
Both are interrelated & interconnected so needs to be holistically tackled
Trans boundary issues, OC&T, CBRN, etc
Army Chief, 2018 -  India is on a war at 2.5 fronts; Against Pakistan, China and PROXY War

1. Neighbourhood Challenges - 
2. Development in Middle East - 
3. Maritime Security -
4. Space Militarisation - 
5. Cyber Space Threats - 
6. Run to control the Scarce resources like energy & strategic minerals - 



## 2 Role of external state and non-state actors in creating challenges to internal security

- Terrorism - A state of terror, panic and a fear psychosis, created by an individual or a group, by way of systematic, planned and organised use of violence as a means to coerce or blackmail authorities to accept their demands or to attain political, religious or ideological goals

There is no universally accepted definition of Terrorism due to lack of political will. A terrorist in one country may be a freedom fighter in eyes of another; and a criminal act may be sponsored by another country. Due to lack of such a  definition, it impeded the curbing of such acts at international level 

### Classification of Terrorism
1. Terrorism aided by External State Actor (Government Aided) - Government itself indulges in act of terrorism against its own citizens or those of other countries. Various forms of support - Financial support, arms & training, technical and infrastructural support  #Eg Pakistan's ISI support to terrorists in J&K.
2. Non-state Actor (Not associated or financed by any Government) - Corporation, NGOs, Paramilitary and Armed resistance groups - Indirect linkages with the government cannot be completely ruled out. Non-state actors may be propped up by a state for use as proxy elements also. #Eg LTTE in Sri Lanka, Naxalites, NE Insurgents

### 4 Major Categories of Terrorism in India
1. Hinterland Terrorism
2. J&K Militancy
3. North East NE Insurgency
4. Left Wing Extremism LWE Naxalism

#### Growth of Hinterland Terrorism
Spread all across hinterland of the country and can be quite without any specific reason. Yet a close observation reveals all the events to be sequential, well planned and well motivated growth of terrorism in India

### Threats by Non-state Actors

1. Multi National Companies MNCs - Powerful mining actions by Vedanta, POSCO and subsequent encroachment of tribal lands results in emergence of Naxalism
2. Religious Institutions & Fanatics - ***Various reports suggest*** that domestic extremist organisations receive financial & ideological support from external religious organisations and foreign countries
3. NGOs - Play obstructionist role. Demand to repeal laws (AFSPA) which can be dangerous in some situations
4. Terrorism - Secessionist movements #Eg Khalistani movement for independent Punjab
5. Insurgency - Demand separate state to regional autonomy #Eg ULFA, Naga insurgents
6. Cyber Attacks - For monetary benefits #Eg Ransomware
7. Indian Diaspora - Sikhs in US, Canada, Australia support the Khalistan issue

## 4 Money laundering and its prevention

- Money Laundering - Process of making Dirty money look like clean money.
Process of creating appearance that money obtained from serious crimes (murder, extortion, smuggling, trafficking) is obtained from a legitimate source
IMF - Global ML Yearly - 2-5% of Global GDP, 800B-2T US$

### Money Laundering process 3 Steps 

1. Placement - Inserts money into a legitimate financial institution. Most riskiest-vulnerable stage
2. Layering - Most complex step. Structuring money into multiple transactions to change its form & make it difficult to trace back. #Eg Bank-bank transfers, wire transfers, purchasing high value items
3. Integration - Re-introduction of money into mainstream to make it look legitimate. Money is finally transferred into local accounts in exchange for some profits
4. Round Tripping - Money is deposited in foreign organisations (usually tax haven countries with weak Anti ML laws) and then brought back to India in form of foreign investment

### Negative Effects of ML
Social - 
Political -
Economic - 
Security -

### Techniques of ML
1. Hawala - Parallel remittance system outside the traditional modes of banking and finance
2. Round tripping - 
3. Shell Companies - On Paper companies only created for converting dirty money to clean, without any business operation/production
4. Third Party Cheques - Paid to a payee who then transfers it to another
5. P-Notes - Derivative instruments for foreign investors
6. Crypto currency - Due to its non-regulatory and decentralised nature, it is the obvious choice of criminals
7. Casino - Purchase coins, but plays little and again reconverts coins to cash, thus showing that money was earned from gambling!
8. Cash Salaries - Dirty money is converted to payments without attracting the law enforcement agencies
9. Structural Deposits - Smurfing - Money is broken down into very small transactions
10. Cash Intensive Business - Businesses such as casino, salons, grocery stores, etc are used to hide dirty money


#### Trade Based ML TBML
1. Over and Under-invoicing of Goods & Services - By way of mis-representing the actual Price
2. Multiple-invoicing 
3. Over and Under-shipment of GS - Phantom Shipments
4. False Description of GS - to gain tax advantage - Customs Fraud

### Challenges for preventing ML
ML is a global phenomena so needs global co-ordination & support

1. International Constraints - Tax haven countries make the fight against ML difficult and weak #Eg Panama, Mauritius 
2. Newer Technologies - Cryptocurrency, digital transfers and their global nature makes tracking difficult
3. Co-ordinated ML Market - ML network is too vast, global and very well organised making it difficult to break and crack it
4. Compliance Failures - Failure of financial institutions make it difficult to identify the sources #Eg Failure to comply with KYC norms, huge cash deposits
5. Lack of Awareness - Public poorly considers ML as only a tax-avoidance measure and fail to get ML connected with the terrorist activities
6. Multi Agency conundrum - Lack of coordination results in MLrers escaping #Eg ED, CBI, FIU, Crime Dept 
7. Fiscal Confidentiality - Tax haven countries have a Confidentiality clause and are reluctant to share the data, providing a blanket
8. Ever expanding Data Volume - Difficult to interconnect transactions for monitoring and risk analysis


### Frameworks for ML Prevention
#### Statutory Frameworks -
Prevention of ML Act, 2002 -
Foreign Management Exchange Act, 1999 - 
Benami Transactions Prohibition Act, 1988 - 
#### Institutional Framework -
