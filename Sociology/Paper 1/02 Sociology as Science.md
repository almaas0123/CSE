### Science
Science is a `systematic` *body* of **knowledge**.

Immanuel Kant: There are two sources of knowledge â€“ Philosophy (deals with statement of values) and Science (deals with statement of facts). There is a logical gap between scientific conclusion and philosophical conclusion. They are qualitatively different.
Neo-Kantian (followers of Kant): Science is nomothetic (tendency to generalize) and philosophy is ideographic (tendency to specify).
Radcliffe-Brown: Sociology is nomothetic.
Max Weber: Sociology is neither nomothetic nor ideographic. It is subjective understanding of objective reality

Giddens puts it, sociology is a scientific endeavour according to this definition, as it involves systematic methods of empirical investigation, analysis of data and assessment of theories in light of evidence and logical argument

There are four sets of postulates which social scientists apply to their disciplines which determines the degree of science involved. These are:  
Ontological | Epistemological | Human Nature | Methodological

To determine if sociology is a science, different schools of thought delved into the nature of these assumptions. And hence we get two approaches along the subjective objective dimension.
Non- or anti- positivism | Positivism
Ontology constructionist and nominalism | objectivist and realism
Epistemology interpretivist | empiricist
Human nature voluntarism | determinism
Methodology ideographic | nomothetic
