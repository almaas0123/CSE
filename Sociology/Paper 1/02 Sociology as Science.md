## Science & Sociology as Science SaS 
***

### Science
Science is a `systematic` *body* of **knowledge**.

### Science
 Science is a systematic organized body of knowledge wherein conclusions are drawn from interrelated facts
 Science is use of systematic methods of empirical investigation, analysis of data, theoretical thinking, and the logical assessment of arguments to develop a body of knowledge about a particular subject matter

#### Goal of Science - 
1. Explain why something happens
2. Make generalizations
3. Predict or specify the future events

#### Characteristics/Features of Science - 
1. It is rooted in empiricism
2. Self reflective and corrective, as its conclusions are open to scepticism. Questioning everything is the nature of Science
3. Rational in nature
4. Based on Objective research methods
5. Based on Facts and not speculations
6. Universal in application across time and space


#### Sociology as Science SaS

Early Social scientists - True knowledge can be gained through sensory perception. Socio is also empirical in approach

Comte - Social Physics
Herbert Spencer - Organismic Analogy ~ Darwinism Evolutionary Biology
ED - Social facts = natural facts
Social statics, Social dynamics, Mechanical equilibrium

Socio has inter-subjective reality, disciplines basic concepts have a universal meaning eg family, religion

ED - Meaning of Social facts remains the same as natural facts. Indirect experimentation to prove empirical validity of socio theories
Weber - Objectivity is possible through methods like Verstehen and Ideal types

#### Limitations SaS
1. Difficulty of being empirical, inductive and universal in applications
2. Controlled & Repeated experimentation isn't possible in Sociology 
3. Difficulty in testing the results
4. Human interactions cannot be quantified so Socio cannot be objective
5. Weber - Social Actions must be understood in terms of meanings that man attaches to them, So there can be no objective science of society
6. Carl Jung - Subjective things like pain, beauty, happiness cannot be measured by Sci methods, so methodology  should be discipline specific



##### Natural Sciences own Limitations
Vagueness, Unpredictability, problems of testability.
Karl Popper - Science is not a body of knowledge, but a method of approaching

Socio & Science share features - Perspectives, subject matter, method of study, etc

## Scientific method and critique
***

### Scientific Method
SM - Systematic, rational, objective set of steps to explore the truth or new knowledge or for investigating phenomena or correcting and integrating previous knowledge 
SM ~ Is related with Discovery of Laws

George Lundberg - SM consists of 3 basic steps - Systematic observation, classification, data interpretation
SM in Socio - To give concrete shapes to the Sociological concepts so that they are understood in the same way by different people. Ensures that Sociology as a body of knowledge is systematised and is given a definite shape

#### SM Elements Characteristics
1. Perspectives and Problem Definition - 
2. Hypothesis Formulation - 
3. Information gathering using research methods & building causal explanations -
4. Interpretations of results, analysis, comparison, classification - 
5. Theory Building - 




#### SM Criticism
1. Karl Popper, The Logic of Scientific Discovery - Sci+SM face problem of Demarcation (what is Scientific and what is not, is subjective at times) Scientific principles are based on Probability and not Finality
2. Social life cannot be Laboratorized - Controlled experimentation isn't possible, to establish Cause & Effect relationship, so not discovery of Fixed Universal Laws
3. Value judgements of researcher, so there cannot be Objective facts as outcome
4. Adorno - Sci is suffocating and kills creativity. It becomes the new Religion, blind faith in it negates human freedom which is an integral part of soc sci
5. JF Feyerbend - SM restricts choices of researcher, socio research should be free & liberating
6. Habermas - Sci is Presumptive
7. Paul Feyerbend - Epistemological Anarchism

Immanuel Kant: There are two sources of knowledge â€“ Philosophy (deals with statement of values) and Science (deals with statement of facts). There is a logical gap between scientific conclusion and philosophical conclusion. They are qualitatively different.
Neo-Kantian (followers of Kant): Science is nomothetic (tendency to generalize) and philosophy is ideographic (tendency to specify).
Radcliffe-Brown: Sociology is nomothetic.
Max Weber: Sociology is neither nomothetic nor ideographic. It is subjective understanding of objective reality

Giddens puts it, sociology is a scientific endeavour according to this definition, as it involves systematic methods of empirical investigation, analysis of data and assessment of theories in light of evidence and logical argument

There are four sets of postulates which social scientists apply to their disciplines which determines the degree of science involved. These are:  
Ontological | Epistemological | Human Nature | Methodological

To determine if sociology is a science, different schools of thought delved into the nature of these assumptions. And hence we get two approaches along the subjective objective dimension.
Non- or anti- positivism | Positivism
Ontology constructionist and nominalism | objectivist and realism
Epistemology interpretivist | empiricist
Human nature voluntarism | determinism
Methodology ideographic | nomothetic

## Major theoretical strands of research methodology
***

RM is a wider term given to the entire process of Research which included specific approach, ideology, RM, research design, data, assumption and logics used in the process

Socio research guided by researchers conception of relation between man and society

Socio Approaches ---> 
Micro and Macro
Positivist and Interpretivists
Functional-Conflict and Ethnomethodology - Symbolic Interactionism




## Positivism and its critique
***

#### First Questions - 
1. Subject matter of Sociology
2. Methodology to be adopted

Influenced by the prevailing atmosphere of rationalism and science, earlier Socios followed a similar line for the new subject to be scientific and objective in terms

Saint Simon, August Comte, ED, Herbert Spencer laid the foundation of Positivistic theory
Society is predictable as it is governed by certain fixed laws. They believed that application of methods based on natural sciences will lead to the Positive Science of Society and evolution of society follows invariable laws. 

Laws of society, true knowledge, causal relationship

Positivism is the approach that employs principles and methods similar to those in natural sciences
Saint Simon - Positivism was rooted in a science of society which is analogous to natural sciences
Comte - Socio is the last & the most sophisticated of all the sciences as t deals with all aspects of humanity and society. Social Dynamics - social change and Social Statics - equilibrium and stability of Social System

#### 4 methods of study -
1. Observation
2. Experimentation 
3. Historical
4. Comparative

### Dimensions of Positivism -
1. Empiricism & Direct Observation
2. Use of SM
3. Experimentation & Theory Building
4. Cause & Effect


### Positivism Features -
1. Emphasis on behaviour that can be directly observed. Feelings and meanings which cannot be directly observed are not seemed to be important
2. Emphasis on understanding External realities, and not internals like meanings and motives.
3. ED - Study of Social Facts as these can be seen objectively
4. Discovery of Cause-Effect relationship while studying phenomena
5. Use of SM similar to Natural sciences. ED used statistical techniques for suicide study
6. Focus was on Empiricism and rejected commonsensical speculation
7. Formulation of grand theories and universality of laws & principles was prime motive
8. Predictability of Social events based on existing knowledge and theory was essential. Comte - Law of social organisation to predict future events
9. Used Deductive approaches - Generalise - Nomothetic
10. Sociological knowledge should be Testable. True Knowledge is the one which can be tested

Human Behaviour & working of society is predictable and so it can be quantified in concrete terms. Positivists make deterministic and predictive statements about the social factors

### Criticism - Inherent Limitations
1. Phenomenologists Peter Berger - Facts never fall from sky, but develop in a particular context
2. Inductive approach would be more helpful as it is difficult to collect facts about abstract phenomena
3. Adorno - Positivism is driven by -ve Dialectics
4. Adorno - Social life exists in layers, but Positivists only focus on 1/2 layers
5. Weber - Contextual study helps, because human behaviour & state of mind is subjective
6. Weber - Socio is a science till it is concerned with meaningful study of social action it a value neutral fashion
7. Positivists explanations are difficult to test
8. Over emphasized on Universalism which isn't possible
9. Anthony Giddens - Actions have multiple interpretations in Sociology & only 1 in Sciences
10. Possible fallouts of over emphasis on Positivism - Scientific Marxism - Fascism, Scientific Racial Explanations 
11. Fundamental misunderstanding of social reality. Weber - Study social action & not social facts. Alfred Schulz - Human construct their world through common sense, ethical values, etc. 
12. Positivism is a Pseudo-Scientific discipline
13. Critical Theorist Habermas - P loses sight of the actors reducing them to passive entities determined by natural forces. Empirical Anarchism - Socio for Humanist approach & not Positivist approach
14. Ritzer - Sociology is a multi pragmatic science in its own sense


However, Positivist freed social sciences from the clutches of religion and speculative philosophy, thus laying a solid foundation of a systematic study of society





## Fact value and objectivity
***
#### Concept
An abstraction representing objects/phenomena. Proxies of objects. Eg - Family, Caste, Kinships, etc
Concepts should be unambiguous, precise and agreed upon by all so as to clarify researchers thinking. Concepts are abstract so must be operationalised. Eg - Social status concept operationalised by indicators like occupation, income

### Fact
Latin word - Factum - Something made or done


/commi

### Value

### Objectivity
