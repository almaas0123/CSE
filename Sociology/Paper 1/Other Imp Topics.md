## Pierre Bourdieu - Education and cultural reproduction

According to Pierre Bourdieu, the major role of education is cultural reproduction. This does not involve the transmission of culture of society as a whole, but instead the reproduction of the culture of the ‘dominant classes’. The dominant classes have the power to define their own culture as ‘worthy of being sought and possessed’ and to establish it as the basis for knowledge in the education system.
Bourdieu refers to the dominant culture as ‘cultural capital’, because via the educational system it can be translated into wealth and power. Cultural capital is not evenly distributed throughout the class structure and this largely accounts for the class differences in education attainment. Students with upper class backgrounds have a built advantage in society because they have been socialized into the dominant culture. Bourdieu claims that, ‘the success of all school education depends fundamentally on the education previously accomplished in the earliest years of life’.
Education in school merely builds on this basis. It does not start from scratch but assumes prior skills and knowledge. Children from the dominant classes have internalized these skills and knowledge in their pre-school years. The educational attainments of social groups is therefore directly related to the amount of cultural capital they possess.
The middle class students have higher success rates that working class students because middle class sub-culture is closer to the dominant culture. Due to their relative lack of dominant culture, working class pupils are more likely to fail examinations and more likely to fail examinations which prevents them from entering higher education.
These arguments lead Bourdieu to conclude that the major role of education in society is the contribution it makes to social reproduction - the reproduction of the relationships of power and privilege between social classes. Social inequality is reproduced in the educational system and as result it is legitimized. The privileged position of dominant classes is justified by educational success, the under privileged position of lower classes is legitimated by  educational failure.

## Pierre Bourdieu - forms of capital

1. Economic capital: It consists of material goods such as property, wealth and income.
2. Social capital: It refers to one's networks of friends and contacts. Bourdieu defined social capital as the resources that individuals or groups gain 'by virtue of possessing a durable network of more or less institutionalized relationships of mutual acquaintance and recognition'.
3. Cultural capital: It refers to types of knowledge, skills and education which confer advantages on those who acquire them. Cultural capital can be embodied (in forms of speech or bodily comportment), objectified (in cultural products such as works of art) or institutionalized (in educational qualifications).
4. Symbolic capital: It refers to social honor, prestige or recognition. The idea of symbolic capital is similar to that of social status. These four forms of capital also differs in the degree of intergenerational transferability. For example, economic capital can be more easily transferred to next generation than other capitals. According to Pierre Bourdieu, one form of capital can be converted to into other forms.

## Robert Putnam - social capital

According to Robert Putnam, social capital refers to connections among individuals - social networks and the norms of reciprocity and trustworthiness that arise from them. Putnam makes a distinction between two kinds of social capital:
1. Bonding capital: Bonding occurs when you are socializing with people who are like you: same age, same race, same religion, and so on.
2. Bridging capital: Bridging is what you do when you make friends with people who are not like you, like supporters of another football team.

He argues that in order to create peaceful societies in a diverse multi-ethnic country, one need to have bridging kind of social capital. Robert Putnam, is his famous work 'Bowling Alone' argues that the USA has undergone an unprecedented collapse in civic, social, associational, and political life since the 1960s. He reasoned that this was due to decline in social capital. Low social capital brings a feeling of alienation within society is associated with additional consequences such as less happiness and lower perceived quality of life.
Critics of Putnam have challenged his claim that social capital has declined. They argue that Putnam has neglected the emergence of new forms of supportive organizations on and off the Internet. Further, the 1960s is a misleading baseline because that era had an unusually high number of traditional organizations.

## William Ogburn - cultural lag

Cultural lag refers to the lag which develops when culture of a society does not keep pace with material changes which are often technological. According to Ogburn, ‘technological progress produces rapid changes in the material aspects of our culture, but the non-material aspects fail to adjust or they do so only after an excessive time lag’. Thus, cultural lag refers to the phenomenon of cultural change being slower than material changes. As a result, many troublesome social problems are created.

Criticism:
1. We must not assume that changes in the material aspects of culture always precede changes in the non-material aspects. There is a constant interaction between the two. In the long run, technological progress itself is largely dependent on certain non- material factors, such as social attitudes.
2. It involves value judgement of what changes are desirable. If desired cultural changes does not take place, it would be labelled as lagging. Thus, the cultural lag is not an objective fact but a result of the observer’s subjective valuation of the state of society.

## Subcultural theories of deviance
1. Albert Cohen: Lower working class have little opportunities to attain success goals of mainstream culture. This leads to frustration and dissatisfaction among them. Hence they reject the success goals of the mainstream culture and replace with an alternative set of norms and values in terms of which they can achieve success and gain prestige. The result is a delinquent subculture. According to Cohen, the delinquent subculture takes its norms from the larger culture but turn them upside down. Thus, a high value is placed on activities such as vandalism which are condemned in the wider society. Cohen thus provides an explanation for delinquent acts which do not appear to be motivated by monetary reward.

2. Richard Cloward and Lloyd Ohlin: They argue that there is greater pressure on members of working class to deviate because they have less opportunity to succeed by legitimate means. There are three possible responses to this situation - ‘criminal subculture’, ‘conflict subculture’ and ‘retreatist subculture’.

- Criminal subculture tend to emerge in areas where there is an established pattern of organized crime. In such areas a learning environment is provided for the young; they are exposed to criminal skills, deviant values and presented with criminal role models. They have access to ‘illegitimate opportunity structure’. Criminal subcultures are mainly concerned with ‘utilitarian crime’ which produces financial reward.
- Conflict subcultures tend to develop in areas where adolescents have little opportunity for access to illegitimate opportunity structures. Thus both legitimate and illegitimate opportunity structures are blocked. The response to this situation is often gang violence which serves as a release for anger and frustration.
- Some lower class adolescents form retreatist subcultures organized mainly around illegal drug use because they have failed to succeed in both the legitimate and illegitimate structures.

3. Walter Miller: Miller argues that in lower class communities, delinquency is a part of the learned cultural values rather than an anomic reaction to unattainable goals.

## Howard Becker - labelling theory  

Howard Becker argues that ‘social groups create deviance by making the rules whose infraction constitutes deviance, and by applying those rules to particular people and labelling them as outsider’. From this point of view, deviance is not a quality of the act the person commits, but rather a consequence of the application by others of the rules and sanctions to an “offender”. Thus the deviant is one to whom the label has been successfully applied; deviant behaviour is behaviour that people so label. Becker is suggesting that in one sense there is no such thing as deviant act. An act become deviant when others perceive and define it as such. For example, in a low-income neighbourhood brawl (rough fight) involving young people may be defined by the police as evidence of delinquency while in a wealthy neighbourhood as evidence of youthful high spirits. The acts are the same but the meanings given to them by the audience differ. Thus Becker argues, ‘deviance is not a quality that lies in behaviour itself, but in the interaction between the person who commits an act and those who respond to it’.  
According to Becker, a label defines an individual as a particular kind of person. It is a master status in the sense that it colors all other status possessed by an individual. If a person is labelled as criminal, the label largely overrides his status as father, worker, neighbour and friend. Others see him and respond to him in terms of the label and tend to assume he has the negative characteristics normally associated with such label. Since an individual’s self-concept is largely derived from the responses of others, he tends to see himself in terms of the label. This may produce a self-fulfilling philosophy whereby ‘the deviant identification becomes the controlling one’. In this context, he confirms and accepts his deviant identity. He may then act in terms of this self-concept which would legitimize his label of a deviant.

## Ethnocentrism  
The term ethnocentrism then refers to the tendency for each society to place its own culture patterns at the centre of things. Ethnocentrism is the practice of comparing other cultural practices with those of one's own and automatically finding those other cultural practices to be inferior.
Functions of ethnocentrism:  
1. It eliminates criticism of the social order.  
2. It encourages the solidarity of the group. Believing that one's own ways are  the best, encourages a "we" feeling with associates.  
3. It promotes continuance of the status quo and hence provides stability to society.

Dysfunctions of ethnocentrism:  
1. It obstructs intercultural relation.  
2. It often result in conflicts.  
3. It prevents social change through diffusion as the present values are held to be superior to that of other cultures.

## Zettelkasten and Sociology!

Paul Otlet, the Belgian pioneer of documentation, worked according to a “monographic principle” (one card, one idea): the idea was to atomize books into conceptual units, which could then be linked through a universal classification.Otlet, _Traité de documentation_, 2015 [1934], pp. 256, 286.  

 
> [!NOTE] German Socio & Zettelkasten
>
==**Niklas Luhmann, a very prolific German sociologist, used a _Zettelkasten_ (card box): a huge set of cards serving as a writing partner, prompting him with suggestions thanks to the methodical interrelation of cards according to shared themes.Luhmann, “Kommunikation mit Zettelkästen,” 1992.**==
 
 More recently, Andy Matuschak has written about [“evergreen notes”](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes): cards which help develop insight, because they are atomic, concept-oriented and, most importantly, densely linked. And if you read Gordon Brander, well, [“all you need is links”](https://subconscious.substack.com/p/all-you-need-is-links): they are immensely expressive and so they can do almost anything—keywords, hierarchies, comments, recommendation, semantics, topic modeling, etc.
