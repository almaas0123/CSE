	2. Political
	3. Technological
	4. Cultural
	5. Environmental

- Sources of SC based on origin 
	 1. Endogenetic
	 2. Exogenetic / Equigenetic





## Sociological Theories of Social Change

- Sociological Theories of SC are classified based on the way Change is viewed
	1. Linear Model of Change
	2. Cyclical
	3. Wave
	4. Growth & Decay
	5. Spiral
	6. Ever expanding
	7. *Post modernist* - No fixed pattern for SC

### Linear / Evolutionary Theories
Adapted from the Biological evolution theory. #Comte #Tylor #Spencer #Marx #ED #Tonnies
- Change is gradual - from Simple to Complex form

1. #Comte used Progressive Evolutionary Model for new forms of Society in Law of 3 Stages. 
	- Intellectual development as the basis of all development. 
	- Law of 3 Stages - 
	  1. Theological - Society is an expression of Gods will. Thinking based on religious ideas and beliefs
	  2. Metaphysical - Started with #Renaissance Society is seen in natural terms. Imaginative thoughts questioned theological dogmas. These are periods of Stability and upheaval known as Organic & Critical Periods. CP inaugurates new phases
	  3. Positivistic - Starts with new scientific discoveries
	    1. Eventually, man would be able to measure empirically and explain conclusively, all forms of social behaviour
	    2. Aspects of SC - Social Statics remain constant, Social Dynamics change
2. #Morgan Moral stages of society - Primitive - Barbaric - Civilised stages of development
3. #Tylor Evolutionary sequence followed 3 stages - Animism - Polytheism - Monotheism. Principal criteria for cultural growth were growth of industrial arts, scientific knowledge, nature of socio-political organisations
4. #ED Evolutionary typology of SC - Society evolves from highly UNdifferentiated (mechanical-simple society) to Highly Differentiated (Organic-complex)
5. LT #Hobhouse SC based on Human Development
	- 5 Stages of Human Society Development
		1. Preliterate
		2. Literacy & Proto Science
		3. Reflective Thought
		4. Critical Thought
		5. Modern Science
6. #Spencer Social Darwinist - Idea of survival of the fittest. Evolution is a twin process of Differentiation & Integration from simple things to complex. Reality is governed by Cosmic Law
	1. Stages of Evolution of societies - Simple - Compound - Doubly compound - Trebly Compound
	2. Theory of Evolution from Militant Societies (involved in warfare) to Industrial Societies (based on friendship, altruism, elaborate specialisation, recognition for achievements)
	3. *Comte* focussed on larger units like family, Spencer on individual. #Comte evolution is in realm of ideas, Intellectual development, while Spencer is in real material world.
7. #Tonnies Ferdinand
