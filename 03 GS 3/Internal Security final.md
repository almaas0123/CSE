## 01 Internal Security
***

- **Internal Security** - Ministry of Home Affairs - Security of a country from within its borders. Upholding sovereignty, and maintenance of peace, law & order within the country. 

- **External Security** -  Defence Ministry - Security of a country from external aggression by another country or foreign elements. 

#### Kautilya Arthshahstra - 4 Types of Threats 
1. Internal - Linguistic riots, Communalism, Ethnic-Caste based violence, Naxalism
2. External - Indo-China War, Foreign Intelligence activities
3. Internally aided External - Support given by some extremist and separatist organisations within the country to foreign nations to destabilise their own country
4. Externally aided Internal - ISI backed JK Militancy
Security perception is a generous mix of all the 4 types

#### Failure on security fronts leads to
1. Loss of sovereignty
2. Disintegration
3. Civil Wars
4. Military Coups
5. Widespread Violence
6. Breakdown of Constitutional Machinery

### Attributes (Requirements) of Int Sec 
1. Secure & protect territorial integrity & internal sovereignty
2. Maintain domestic peace
3. Uphold Law & Order
4. Peaceful co-existence and Communal Harmony
5. Absence of Fear

#### Major Challenges to Int Sec
1. Hinterland Terrorism - Domestic & International
2. J&K Militancy Terrorism
3. NE Insurgency
4. Left Wing Extremism - Naxalism
5. Organised Crime & its nexus with Terrorism
6. Communalism -  Religious fault lines
7. Caste - Ethnic tensions
8. Regionalism & Inter-state disputed - Linguistic riots
9. Border Management
10. Coastal Security
11. Cyber Security
12. Threats due to terrorism, narcotics and drugs, small arms proliferation, voids in energy requirement and information warfare loon large on the horizon

### Root causes - Factors for Int Sec problems
1. Partition related inherited problems
	1. Unfriendly neighbours
	2. Poverty & Unemployment
2. Administrative failures
	1. Inequitable growth
	2. Wealth & Opportunity gap
	3. Governance deficit - Maladministration
3. Partisan Politics
	1. Rising Communalism
	2. Increased Caste awareness & caste tensions
	3. Identity Politics (+ Sectorial Identities) based on divisive criteria
	4. Separatist tendencies
4. Other factors
	1. Porous Borders
	2. Corruption
	3. Poor Criminal Justice System
	4. Nexus between criminals - politicians - Police
	5. Inter-state disputed over boundary and natural resources can lead to violent flares and harm the unity & federal structure of the nation

### Key Elements of Int Sec Doctrine
1. Political - Analyse the nature and causative factors and check whether the demands are within the Constitutional framework.
	1. Secessionist Movements - Needs to be curbed with a heavy hand
	2. Separatists Movements - Kept at a safe distance
	3. Regional & Ethnic aspirations - Reasonably softer and sympathetic approach
2. Socio-Economic - Genuine socio-economic grievances arise from shortage of resources, poverty-unemployment, displacement. The connected issues should be addressed to ensure equitable growth and development with no regional disparities
3. Governance - Anti-establishment elements ride on the corruption, mismanagement, poor implementation of laws and absence of government machinery in remote areas. It is the duty of state to control corruption and provide good governance on civil and police sides
4. Security Forces - Police - Police & military atrocities and indifference often aggravate the grievances and raises the security problems, #Eg AFSPA. Police needs to be sensitised and be more citizen friendly. Central forces should also understand the local context and situations and maintain highest order of efficiency while being transparent, professional and neutral
5. Centre State Coordination - Problem exists in all areas ranging from intelligence to operations. Institutional frameworks needs to be prepared to resolve the problem and brig in synergies at all levels
6. Intelligence, a major component - Defensive & Offensive intelligence is required to forewarn and neutralise the threats. Regular institutional framework is required to compile, collate and act on intelligence inputs 
7. Border Management - Effective guarding of land and coastal borders is the key to a safer country. Illegal immigration, infiltration, smuggling drugs-cattle-arms, etc are the rampant problems
8. Cyber Security - Cyberspace will be a theatre of warfare. Snowden Wikileaks, 2013 reveal that future wars will not be traditional wars fought on land, water or air

### Measures to strengthen IntSec
1. Stringent laws (& its implementation) against Communal hatred and propaganda 
2. Comprehensive policy to curb black money 
3. Targeted approach for Poverty alleviation
4. Police Reforms
5. Regulation on Social Media
6. Comprehensive strategy to tackle Naxalism
7. National Counter Terrorism Centre NCTC
8. Reforms in CAPF, CRPF
9. Border Management
10. National Cyber Security Policy, 2020


### External Security Challenges - 
Both are interrelated & interconnected so needs to be holistically tackled
Trans boundary issues, OC&T, CBRN, etc
Army Chief, 2018 -  India is on a war at 2.5 fronts; Against Pakistan, China and PROXY War

1. Neighbourhood Challenges - Achilles Heel of India's Foreign Policy
2. Development in Middle East - Cultural, Trade ties since ancient times. Decreasing US influence, religious sentiments, forex influx, petroleum trade
3. Maritime Security - Natural disasters, piracy, trafficking
4. Space Militarisation - Weaponization of Space was avoided but still Militarisation of Space has rapidly occurred 
5. Cyber Space Threats - Multi-faceted, more intense and shaking across diverse domains
6. Run to control the Scarce resources like energy & strategic minerals - Key factor in border tensions
	Kofi Annan - Shortage of natural resources can contribute to unrest and civil wars
	"Competition for Natural Resources" a Global Challenge - EU Security Strategy
	#Eg Strategic importance of Arunachal, Lower-Upper Riparian of rivers, Fishing rich waters

## 2 Role of external state and non-state actors in creating challenges to internal security
***

- **Terrorism** - A state of terror, panic and a fear psychosis, created by an individual or a group, by way of systematic, planned and organised use of violence as a means to coerce or blackmail authorities to accept their demands or to attain political, religious or ideological goals

There is no universally accepted definition of Terrorism due to lack of political will. A terrorist in one country may be a freedom fighter in eyes of another; and a criminal act may be sponsored by another country. Due to lack of such a  definition, it impeded the curbing of such acts at international level 

### Classification of Terrorism
1. **Terrorism aided by External State Actor** (Government Aided) - Government itself indulges in act of terrorism against its own citizens or those of other countries. Various forms of support - Financial support, arms & training, technical and infrastructural support  #Eg Pakistan's ISI support to terrorists in J&K.
2. **Non-state Actor** (Not associated or financed by any Government) - Corporation, NGOs, Paramilitary and Armed resistance groups - Indirect linkages with the government cannot be completely ruled out. Non-state actors may be propped up by a state for use as proxy elements also. #Eg LTTE in Sri Lanka, Naxalites, NE Insurgents

### 4 Major Categories of Terrorism in India
1. Hinterland Terrorism
2. J&K Militancy
3. North East NE Insurgency
4. Left Wing Extremism LWE Naxalism

#### Growth of Hinterland Terrorism
Spread all across hinterland of the country and can be quite without any specific reason. Yet a close observation reveals all the events to be sequential, well planned and well motivated growth of terrorism in India
#Eg Bombay Blasts, Samjhauta express blasts


### Funding Mechanism and Training Support for Terrorism

#left 



### State Actors influencing Terrorism in India
#left 

#### Pakistan

#### China


#### Nepal


#### Bangladesh


#### Myanmar


#### Afghanistan




### Threats by Non-state Actors

1. Multi National Companies MNCs - Powerful mining actions by Vedanta, POSCO and subsequent encroachment of tribal lands results in emergence of Naxalism
2. Religious Institutions & Fanatics - ***Various reports suggest*** that domestic extremist organisations receive financial & ideological support from external religious organisations and foreign countries
3. NGOs - Play obstructionist role. Demand to repeal laws (AFSPA) which can be dangerous in some situations
4. Terrorism - Secessionist movements #Eg Khalistani movement for independent Punjab
5. Insurgency - Demand separate state to regional autonomy #Eg ULFA, Naga insurgents
6. Cyber Attacks - For monetary benefits #Eg Ransomware
7. Indian Diaspora - Sikhs in US, Canada, Australia support the Khalistan issue

## 4 Money laundering and its prevention
***

> [!NOTE] Money Laundering
> Process of making Dirty money look like clean money.
> Process of creating appearance that money obtained from serious crimes (murder, extortion, smuggling, trafficking) is obtained from a legitimate source
		IMF - Global ML Yearly - 2-5% of Global GDP, 800B-2T US$


- **Money Laundering** - Process of making Dirty money look like clean money.
Process of creating appearance that money obtained from serious crimes (murder, extortion, smuggling, trafficking) is obtained from a legitimate source
	IMF - Global ML Yearly - 2-5% of Global GDP, 800B-2T US$

### Money Laundering process 3 Steps 

1. **Placement** - Inserts money into a legitimate financial institution. Most riskiest-vulnerable stage
2. **Layering** - Most complex step. Structuring money into multiple transactions to change its form & make it difficult to trace back. #Eg Bank-bank transfers, wire transfers, purchasing high value items
3. **Integration** - Re-introduction of money into mainstream to make it look legitimate. Money is finally transferred into local accounts in exchange for some profits

### Negative Effects of ML

1. **Security**
	Increase in OCs 
	1. Increase in Organised Crimes - ML drives the criminals on terror funding, arms dealing
	2. Terrorism & Naxalism - Money obtained from illegal ways is used to further the malaise propaganda
	3. Cybercrimes - Emerging technologies boost ways to earn money #Eg online betting-gambling, online lottery scams; and clean the traces using crypto currency & foreign fund transfers 
2. **Social**
	1. Degrades the moral & ethical values - Higher ML in society disrupts the society by way of rampant corruption
	2. Human Trafficking - Human life gets objectified and more value is given to money resulting in trafficking & prostitution 
	3. Economic Power - Criminals get control of the institutions & manipulates economic balance in their own favour
	4. Unemployment & Poverty - Vicious cycle of low development, less tax collection and market bubble bursts leads to rise in UnP
	5. Increased Inequality - Income distribution is affected negatively, making the rich richer
	6. Anti-Social Activities - ML and crime are closely related, so frauds, scams get frequent & voluminous
3. **Political** #left 
	1. Diversification in Government Spending - 
	2. Fall in Government Trustworthiness -
	3. Political Instability Turmoil -
	4. Criminalisation of Politics -
4. **Economic**
	1. Liability of Financial Institutions -
	2. Growth Rate -
	3. Money Flow -
	4. 

### Techniques of ML

1. Hawala - Parallel remittance system outside the traditional modes of banking and finance
2. Round tripping - Money is deposited in foreign organisations (usually tax haven countries with weak Anti ML laws) and then brought back to India in form of foreign investment
3. Shell Companies - On Paper companies only created for converting dirty money to clean, without any business operation/production
4. Third Party Cheques - Paid to a payee who then transfers it to another
5. P-Notes - Derivative instruments for foreign investors
6. Crypto currency - Due to its non-regulatory and decentralised nature, it is the obvious choice of criminals
7. Casino - Purchase coins, but plays little and again reconverts coins to cash, thus showing that money was earned from gambling!
8. Cash Salaries - Dirty money is converted to payments without attracting the law enforcement agencies
9. Structural Deposits - Smurfing - Money is broken down into very small transactions
10. Cash Intensive Business - Businesses such as casino, salons, grocery stores, etc are used to hide dirty money


#### Trade Based ML TBML

1. Over and Under-invoicing of Goods & Services - By way of mis-representing the actual Price
2. Multiple-invoicing - for the same goods, so as to adjust the dirty money as legitimate
3. Over and Under-shipment of GS - Phantom Shipments
4. False Description of GS - to gain tax advantage - Customs Fraud

### Challenges for preventing ML

ML is a global phenomena so needs global co-ordination & support
1. International Constraints - Tax haven countries make the fight against ML difficult and weak #Eg Panama, Mauritius 
2. Newer Technologies - Cryptocurrency, digital transfers and their global nature makes tracking difficult
3. Co-ordinated ML Market - ML network is too vast, global and very well organised making it difficult to break and crack it
4. Compliance Failures - Failure of financial institutions make it difficult to identify the sources #Eg Failure to comply with KYC norms, huge cash deposits
5. Lack of Awareness - Public poorly considers ML as only a tax-avoidance measure and fail to get ML connected with the terrorist activities
6. Multi Agency conundrum - Lack of coordination results in MLers escaping #Eg ED, CBI, FIU, Crime Dept 
7. Fiscal Confidentiality - Tax haven countries have a Confidentiality clause and are reluctant to share the data, providing a blanket
8. Ever expanding Data Volume - Difficult to interconnect transactions for monitoring and risk analysis


### Frameworks for ML Prevention

#left 
#### Statutory Frameworks
1. Prevention of ML Act, 2002 -
2. Foreign Management Exchange Act, 1999 - 
3. Benami Transactions Prohibition Act, 1988 -

Enforcement Directorate ED -
Finance Intelligence Unit FIU -

#### International Cooperation
Financial Action Task Force FATF -
Vienna Convention -
Basel Committee on Banking regulation -
International ML Information Network -
Asia-Pacific Group on ML -
UN Global Programme against ML -

### FATF Key Recommendations on ML Prevention

### Black Money

- **Black Money** - is the one that is hidden from Tax Authorities irrespective of its origin & may be obtained from legal/illegal sources
- **Parallel Economy** - All economic activities that remain unmeasured and unreported by current method of monitoring economic activities, they are outside the purview of tax authorities

#### Reasons for generation of Black Money
1. Tax Evasion - To evade payment of taxes or any other Statutory contributions
2. Tax Avoidance - Evade minimum wages, working hours, safety standards 
3. Evade complying to laws and administrative procedure
4. Hide income from illegal sources #Eg Corruption, smuggling, racketeering, security frauds

#### Sources of BM
1. Undervaluation of Income - Avoid issuing authentic bills so as to hide transactions
2. Real Estate - Undervalued transactions results into lower stamp duties & capital gain tax
3. Informal Sector - Highly cash based, so cannot be traced
4. NGOs - Avail tax concessions in name of Charity! CBI to SC - Only 10% NGOs filed annual income-expenditure statements
5. Tax Haven Countries
6. Hawala
7. P-Notes
8. Corruption

#### Imapct on Society
1. Causes regressive distribution of income on society
2. Inequality gap widens - rich become richer
3. Government loses taxes which impedes proper growth and development of society

#### Challenges to Curbing Black MOney
1. Non Quantifiable Data - Tax authorities have no record due to anonymity, fraudulent transactions & involvement of informal sector
2. Corruption - Criminal - Authority nexus
3. Loopholes in Legal System Law
4. Lack of Digital Land Records - Land is shown undervalued for real estate deals
5. Cash based Transactions - McKinsey Report - 89% of transactions in India are cash based and difficult to trace
6. Lack of Awareness - Citizens consider tax as a burden rather than seeing it as a duty

#### Strategy to tackle the menace of BM 
1. Preventing generation
2. Discouraging Use
3. Effective detection
4. Effective investigation and adjudication
5. Regulated use of large denominations

## 5 Linkages of organized crime with terrorism
***

- **Organised Crime** - A structured group of 3/+ persons existing for a period of time & acting in concert with the aim of committing serious crimes or offences to obtains, directly or indirectly, financial or other material benefits
	- **Traditional Organised Crimes** - Betting, gambling, illicit liquor trade, kidnapping-extortion, contract killing, pornography, robbery, blackmailing, sand-mining mafia
	- **Non-traditional OC** - Transnational crimes like ML, FICN, hawala transfers, cybercrimes, drugs-arms smuggling, human trafficking, illegal immigration, CBRN, maritime piracy, infiltration of illegal business

### Transnational OC - UN Convention - TOC comprises of 
1. Structure - Group of 3/+ persons, not formed randomly
2. Continuity - Existing for a period of time
3. Acting in concert with the aim of committing at least 1 crime punishable by at least 4 years of incarceration
4. Goal - To obtain, directly or indirectly, a financial or material benefit

### Main Characteristics
1. Profit driven character
2. Seriousness of the offences they commit

### Differences Matrix (OC-Terrorism & Traditional-Modern)
#left 

### Difference between Terrorism & OC
#left 


### Factors responsible for exacerbating OCs
1. Increased demand for illegal goods in global markets #Eg human organs, drugs, endangered animals
2. Geographical terrains and Open borders
3. Unholy Nexus of Politicians - Criminals - Bureaucracy
4. Technological Anonymity - Reduces risk and provides operational safety
5. Globalisation of Economy

  
### Issues & Challenges in Combatting OC
1. No Specific Law - Absence of specialised law - Currently dependent o carious IPC provisions scattered around
2. Leadership Anonymity - Structured hierarchies and periodic change of leadership makes identification of leaders difficult
3. Lack of Resources - Policing is a state subject and state police is not well equipped and trained to handle OCs
4. Absence of a Specialised Central Agency - to deal with OCs at national level
5. Trans-national Presence - Tough terrains and unfriendly neigh our provide safe havens to the criminals
6. Poor and Burdened Criminal Justice System - Criminals exploit the loopholes in the system.
   >Currently ~3 Crore Pending Cases in Indian Judiciary


### Link between OC & Terrorism ~Symbiotic Relationship

Terrorists indulge in OC to generate a constant stream of income to support their cause and operations. Many a times OCs & Terrorist both operate under the same superstructure. Both operate using modern day tech and communication, in areas of open borders and weak enforcement of laws, ineffective governance and a poor system of checks and balances. One provides protection in return for materials benefits and moving operatives around the world

Symbiotic Relationship - Neither both are same nor totally different +National&TransnationalLevel
- Developed Countries - OC thrives with or without Terrorist collaboration
- Developing - Linkage is at varying levels
- Transnational Syndicates - Highly related

#### Black Hole Syndrome at the Unholy Convergence

>Our Success largely depends on understanding each problem separately in isolation & also by focussing on the versatile connections and correlations

<Diagram Space\>





### Linkages 
Both groups engage and operate together more than ever before. OC needs a Client & Courier to smuggle arms, drugs and humans across countries and regions


#### Links in North-East NE Insurgents
1. Extortion, kidnapping as a source of revenue for funding insurgency 
2. Courier service for illegal drugs and arms

#### Links in LWE Affected Areas
1. Extortion is the common phenomena
2. Robberies is on the rise
3. There have been reports of cuts being enforced on drug yielding crops in the region

### Factors-Reasons for Linkages
1. Complimenting Activities and Nature of Work - Client-Courier relationship
2. Mis-governance
3. Poor Infrastructure & Unemployment - Hotbed for easy recruits and fast money medium
4. Unfenced Borders - Fertile ground for illicit trade
5. Growing IT Environment - Easy bonding and operational anonymity

### How can the link be broken?

## 6 Basics of Cyber Security + Challenges to through communication networks
***

- **Cyber Security - IT Act, 2000** - Protecting information, equipment, devices computer, computer resource, communication device and information stored therein from unauthorised access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification or destruction
	- Protection of systems, networks, data in cyberspace 

### Cyber Threats
The expanding wireless connectivity to individual computers and personal handsets and networks is making determination of physical and logical boundaries of networks increasingly difficult
The difficulty in security is primarily due to the diffused and varied nature of threats and inability to frame an adequate response in the absence of tangible perpetrators

1. Cyber Crime (against an individual/group) -  An unlawful act where a device or network is used to commit/facilitate the crime
2. Cyber Warfare (against State) - Deliberate attacking of information systems for strategic-military purpose
3. Cyber Espionage - Use of computer networks to gain illicit access to confidential information
4. Cyber Terrorism - International use of computers, networks & public internet to cause public destruction and harm
	1. Physical Attacks - Traditional way bombs, fire
	2. Syntactic Attack - Damaging the logic of system to induce delays or make the system unpredictable #Eg Virus, Trojan, Ransomware
	3. Semantic Attack - Information is modified to induce errors #Eg Data Diddling, DDOS

- **Cyber Space** - Cyber Security Policy, 2013 - Complex environment consisting of interactions between people, software and services, supported by worldwide distribution of information and communication technology (ICT) devices and networks

> [!NOTE] Data
>Global Information Safety Report - India has one of the highest numbers of cyber-attacks and the country ranks second in terms of targeted attacks

5. Instigating Riots
6. False Opinion Building
7. Inciting Communal Violence
8. Polarization
9. Cyber Bullying
10. Behavioural Impacts - Anxiety, Depression, Addiction, Loneliness - #Eg FOMO

### Role of SM in National Security 

Large Scale penetration of SM due to digitization and low cost internet, as created challenges for security agencies due to its vast and unstructured nature. But with challenges it has come up with some wonderful opportunities too

#### Positives
1. Intelligence Gathering - #Eg Social Network Analysis, Pattern generation
2. Engaging with Citizens - Updating citizens with important information
3. Data Mining - Using data & metadata to identify suspects
4. Policing - An effective tool for social policing
5. Operational Ease - Investigating and gathering evidence
6. Maintaining Law & Order - Gathering and disseminating information

#### Challenges
1. Cyber Terrorism -  #EG Creating a sympathy wave for Hizbul Commander Burhan Wani
2. Spreading Hatred - # Palghar mob lynching's
3. Hacking - Personal risk and also targeting Critical Infrastructure
4. Recruiting Platform - Spread ideology and brainwash the youth
5. Money Laundering
6. Deep / Dark Web
7. Difficulty in tracing

### Key Issues related to SM

1. Freedom of Speech and Expression vis-à-vis Defamation, National Sovereignty & Integrity
2. Right to Privacy
3. Accountability
4. Right to be Forgotten

### Regulation of SM

#### Present Scenario

#### Need for Regulation
1. Exponential Increased Usage
2. (Mis)Information spreads like fire
3. Curbing Illegal Activities
4. L&O especially Violence

#### Challenges
1. Right to Privacy - Agencies require data of users for law enforcement and surveillance
2. Freedom of Speech & Expression
3. Database in Foreign Jurisdiction
4. Companies reluctant to share data
5. Encrypted Nature of Data
6. Accountability Issues 
7. Anonymity & Fake Profiles

#### Why Not to Regulate?
1. Unconstitutional 
2. Leads to Commercial Use of Private Data
3. Disempower some sections - #Eg #MeToo would be crushed
4. Surveillance will increase to a large extent
5. Curbs Dissent and genuine Grievances 
6. Wrong linking with SM - Fake News is not a child of SM rather an age old problem

### New IT Rules related to SM and OTT Platforms

>***Provisions -> Implications -> Way Forward***

#left 



### Way Forward SM
- Social media comes up with both good and bad things hence it is up to the users and government to make proper use of this technology. Further, it is the responsibility of every user to cross check every information before forwarding it and it is also the responsibility of the government to make people digitally literate enough so that they can efficiently use social media. When it comes to regulation, rational regulation without affecting constitutional rights is the need of the hour


### Fake News
- **Fake News** - Any form of false / misleading information spread deliberately

#### Causes


#### Challenges
