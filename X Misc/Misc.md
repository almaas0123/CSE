First,¬†[the most impactful advice I ever got about juggling priorities](https://ashleyjanssen.com/how-to-juggle-priorities-decide-which-balls-are-glass-and-which-are-plastic/)¬†comes from Nora Roberts, one of the most prolific and successful authors alive.

> ‚ÄúThe key to juggling is to know that some of the balls you have in the air are made of plastic and some are made of glass. And if you drop a plastic ball, it bounces, no harm done. If you drop a glass ball, it shatters, so you have to know which balls are glass and which are plastic and prioritize catching the glass ones.‚Äù
