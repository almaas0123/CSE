# Approach to Answer Writing for the Sociology Optional of the UPSC CSE
***

Answer Writing

First, please ensure that, in your notes, you have content of at least 400 words, for every topic that has been mentioned in the Syllabus. All the sources I have mentioned above are almost enough for this. For Chapter 4 (Sociological Thinkers) of Paper 1, apart from the concept given by the Thinkers and its criticism, also have content ready on the current relevance and current examples of those concepts. And if possible, also have content ready on the current relevance and current examples of concepts given by Thinkers from the other Chapters, of both Paper 1 and Paper 2, as well.

Also, please have content ready for everything that has been asked in the Question Papers of at least the past ten years (except for those topics which are no more a part of the Syllabus). For very few questions, whose answer content I did not have in my notes, I referred to the solved previous years’ Sociology papers by Chronicle Publications. The answers in this book are not that good, and hence please use it minimally.

As mentioned above, in these two attempts, I wrote three different Test Series for Sociology. The feedback I got for my answers was very helpful, and I worked on whatever improvements they suggested. If possible, do please join a Test Series, preferably after you finish your own notes-making. However, the most important thing is to work on the inputs and the suggestions received.

The key to good marks in Sociology is to write the answers ‘sociologically’.

Firstly, try and quote as many Thinkers as possible. My target was to quote at least four Thinkers in a 20 marker, and at least two Thinkers in a 10 marker. But please quote only those Thinkers which are relevant to the question that has been asked.

If Thinkers are not available, especially in Paper 2, wherever possible, try and quote facts, statistics, government schemes and their outcomes, government reports and their recommendations, committee recommendations, details of judgements and other such data. The Social Issues Vision Mains 365 document, and the Government Schemes Vision PT 365 document, are what I referred to, for this type of data.

You can also use examples and case studies from the current affairs, wherever possible, in both Paper 1 as well as Paper 2. For these, besides my own notes from the newspaper, I referred to the three sources already mentioned above.

Make Paper 1 your strength because it is largely static, questions do get repeated, and there are enough Thinkers available for almost all the topics.

You can quote some Paper 1 Thinkers in Paper 2 as well, but please do not overdo it. Likewise, Indian Thinkers from Paper 2 can be quoted in Paper 1 too, but again sparingly.

In the exam, try and select those questions which are based on the static portion, so that you already have enough content and Thinkers to write.

For static questions, generally this standard framework fits really well:

-   Explaining the sociological concept, its criticism, its current relevance and current examples or case studies related to that concept.

Even for questions that are based on the current affairs, or questions that seem to be from the GS, make your answer ‘Sociological’. This is what you need to do for it:

-   First remember every topic mentioned in the Syllabus. Then, for the given question, analyze how the core issue that the question is asking, has an impact on, or is impacted by, the different topics of the Syllabus.  
    or
-   Analyze how the core issue that the question is asking, is interpreted as per some of the theories like the Structural-Functional Theory, the Conflict Theory, the Feminist Theory, the Symbolic Interactionist Theory.

These three frameworks can be used together as well, especially for the 20 markers.

Let me explain this with examples from Mains 2019 –

In both Paper 1 and Paper 2, apart from the compulsory Q1. and Q5., I attempted Q4., Q6. and Q8.

Paper 1 – _Q. Discuss the issues of access and exclusion in higher education in India._

This seems like a question from Paper 2, but it was asked in Paper 1. So quickly recall the Syllabus topics of Paper 1. Some topics that fit in here are:

_Alienation_ – the curriculum is based on middle-class values and is alienating for students from the other classes. Also, many courses are not available in regional languages, again causing alienation.

_Suicide_ – discrimination in higher education institutions led to suicides by Rohith Vemula and Dr. Payal Tadvi.

_Pattern Variables_ – education system is part of the AGIL framework.

_Deviance_ – due to lack of access to higher education, some students may become deviant.

_Social exclusion_, _poverty_, _class_ – lower participation of poor, Dalits, Tribals and Minorities in higher education.

_Gender_ – lower participation of women in STEM courses.

_Social mobility_ – higher education can be a source of social mobility. Lack of it perpetuates poverty.

_Informal organizations_ – they see a large participation of those who could not access or were excluded from higher education.

_Power elite_ – they use entrance exams or other such criteria to restrict the access to higher education for the masses. Also, increasing privatization of higher education.

_Religion_ – students who have completed basic education from the Madarsas, may face difficulty in accessing higher education.

_Education and social change_ – without an inclusive and accessible system of higher education, social change is not possible.

You can similarly think of points related to some other topics of the Syllabus. Not all the points are equally important, and the more important points should be written in the beginning. If required, points can also be written from the Syllabus topics of Paper 2.

_Migration_ – migration towards urban areas is seen due to lack of access to higher education in the rural areas.

_Social Movements_ – student movements arising from higher education institutes have played an important role in India.

Some data that can be quoted here are the Sukhadeo Thorat Committee, Xaxa Committee and the Ranganath Misra Commission.

Paper 1 – _Q. What is affirmative action? Substantiate theoretical positions on affirmative actions with examples._

Affirmative action is a form of sponsored mobility as stated by RH Turner.

Here we need to analyze affirmative action as per some of the Sociological theories.

_Structural-functionalism_ – affirmative action provides opportunities to the various deprived sections of the society. This helps avoid protests or a revolution, thus maintaining social equilibrium. Example – once the EWS reservation was announced, a dominant caste stopped the protests demanding reservation for their community.

_Conflict_ – affirmative action only provides mobility to a limited number of people. Thus, it is like a safety valve used by the bourgeoisie. Due to some successful examples, it perpetuates the false belief that the system is an open system. It thus prevents true class consciousness from emerging. Example – rags-to-riches stories are over glorified using the ideological state apparatus, to give the proletariat a false hope that anyone can achieve the same.

_Feminist_ – affirmative action only gives token representation to women. The true power is still wielded by men, and structural inequality remains. Example – _Sarpanch pati._

Some data that can be quoted here are the Indra Sawhney judgement, the M. Nagaraj judgement and the Sinho Commission.

For additional points, quickly recall the Syllabus topics of Paper 1 and write on the topics that fit in here.

Paper 2 – _Q. Highlight the main features of the ‘Inter-linking of Rivers’ project in India. What could be its probable advantages to Indian agriculture._

This was a 20 marker, and the points we know from GS can barely fill two pages. Thus, recalling the Syllabus topics of Paper 2, some topics that fit in here are:

_Land tenure system_ – can lead to a rise in capitalistic farming and bullock cart capitalists, as land hitherto unutilized due to lack of water, can also be brought under cultivation.

_Tribal communities_ – may lead to their displacement, alienation, loss of tribal way of life, ecological imperialism.

_Agrarian class_, _caste system_ – large farmers, most of whom are from the dominant castes, are more likely to benefit.

_Middle class_, _social mobility_ – farmers benefiting from assured water availability will rise to the middle class. Also, tourism, logistics and other such activities that will see a boost due to the inter-linking of rivers, will see a class of small entrepreneurs or petty bourgeoisie rising.

_Family and marriage_ – case study on ‘water wives’.

_Religious communities_ – religious ceremonies, which were performed in the river or on the river banks, may face difficulty if the course of the river is diverted.

_Rural development_, _poverty alleviation_ – self-explanatory.

_Regionalism_ – inter-linking of rivers is a long duration project, and if the state governments change, issues may arise. Past example of the Cauvery water dispute.

_Peasants and farmers movements_ – may decline.

_Environmental movements_ – may rise.

_Migration_ – migration towards urban areas may decline as opportunities may come up even in small towns and rural areas.

_Environmental problems and sustainability_ – climate change in the future may raise a question on the feasibility of this project.

Also, using the Sociological theories:

_Structural-functionalism_ – the project will contribute to maintenance of social equilibrium. This is because agriculture may become more remunerative and other employment opportunities may also rise, thus preventing any protests or a revolution.

_Conflict_ – it will only perpetuate false class consciousness. All the benefits will be garnered by the influential land-owning class and the urban bourgeoisie. Also, it takes away the attention from the other structural issues like declining soil fertility, over-use of fertilizers and pesticides, poor skill training opportunities, lack of access to capital.

Please do not force-fit any points. Not all Syllabus topics or Sociological theories may apply to a particular question. Also, not all the points are equally important, and the more important points should be written in the beginning, and in case of space or time crunch, you can skip writing the less important points.

If needed, these standard frameworks from GS can also be used. But please use them sparingly, and that too only and only if the above three frameworks do not seem to work.

-   5 Ws and 1 H – Who, What, When, Where, Why and How – not all of them may be applicable, so choose only those that are relevant to the question
-   past, present and possible future
-   positives, negatives and possible improvements
-   structural issues, functional issues and their solutions
-   short-term, medium-term and long-term view
-   PESTEL (political, economic, social, technological, environmental and legal) issues
-   SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats)

Even for Sociology, I wrote all the answers in the Introduction – Body – Conclusion format. And I wrote all the answers in the point format. Many prefer using the paragraph format while writing the answers in the Optional papers. So please choose whichever method suits you the best.

In the Introduction, I mostly defined, using some Thinker, whatever the most important term of the question was. Or I just rephrased the question statement in a simpler manner.

The Body of the answer consisted of addressing each part of the question. For every part, I wrote one line, explaining what that part is about, and then wrote some 3-4 points addressing that part in detail. This format of one sentence, then 3-4 points, then again one sentence, then again 3-4 points and so on, makes the answer visually better than simply writing the whole answer in only points or only paragraphs.

If the question did not seem to have any parts, I divided the question into parts using either the Sociological frameworks or some of the GS frameworks that I have already mentioned above.

Please do not force-fit any of these formats in your answer. Instead, depending on the question, see which one fits the best and use the same. You can also combine two or more of these formats. And even if the question already has parts, you can still use these formats to further write a more detailed answer. There is no standard way of deciding which format fits which questions the best, and only by experimenting while writing the Test Series can you get a fair idea about it. But do please remember to add as much flavour of Sociology as possible, in whatever you write.

And I wrote a short and optimistic Conclusion, restricted to two or three sentences only. It was mostly related to the ‘way forward’ regarding the most important term of the question.

In the exam, in the beginning, I quickly read all the questions and selected which sets of questions I would be attempting. I tried to select those question sets where I knew the 20 markers really well. And as far as possible, I tried to select those questions which were based on the static portion. In the first 90 minutes, I answered all the 20 markers, and in the next 90 minutes, I answered all the 10 markers.

Thanks to big handwriting and good spacing, I also managed to fill all the pages. I even filled all the four pages for all the 20 markers. I am not sure if this translates into more marks, but filling all the pages does seem to give an impression that a lot of content has been written.

I
