# Unit 06 Work and Economic Life
***

> [!quote] Work - Aristotle
> "Work is not merely a means to an end; it is an end in itself"

### Notion of Work
1. Natural Sciences - Expenditure of Energy
2. Sociology - Work is a social #activity performed in groups. It is about the power relations, social dynamics, conflicts, functions performed, etc.

#Work - Carrying of tasks requiring the expenditure of physical & mental efforts, with the objective of production of goods and services catering to human needs  #defn 
Economic Sociology - Work is an #activity which results in paid employment, reward or contract  #defn 

#Work is the basis of Economy! Integral to human existence
Study of Work in sociology is important because economy & production influence all other parts of the society
#Industrialization & #Modernisation together led to the formation of new discipline Sociology [[01 Sociology - The Discipline|Unit 01]]

#Marx Work/Production of goods & services is an avenue of expression of creativity & a way to happiness and satisfaction. When workers loose control they are #alienated
#ED Work is an integrating force in modern societies and forms the basis of organic #solidarity
#### Sociological Perspectives on Work
1. **Functionalist perspective** - Views work as a social institution that is necessary for the smooth functioning of society. Work provides with goods and services needed to survive, and helps to create social order and stability
2. **Conflict perspective** - Views work as a source of inequality and exploitation. Workers are often forced to work long hours for low pay, and have little control over their work environment
3. **Symbolic interactionist perspective** - Views work as a social process that is shaped by the interactions with others. Meaning of work is negotiated through interactions with coworkers, supervisors, and customers

## Need of Work in Society
***
### Importance of Work in modern societies
1. Source of Income & Living - Money Market
2. Breaks monotony of domestic life
3. Gives #identity to a person, as in Industrial societies, a person is known by the work carried out
4. Gives identity, purpose & social status to a person
5. Provides opportunity to build Social Capital
6. Directs human energy in constructive way to acquire skills
7. Source of satisfaction & fulfilment 

### Social Significance of Work
1. Personal Identity - Work is valued for sense of social (stable) identity. Especially for men, self-esteem is bounded to economic contribution for household
2. Money - Economic need
3. Activity level - Experiment & experience Skills
4. Variety - Breaks monotony
5. Temporal Structure - Proved sense of direction on a daily basis
6. Social Contracts - Friendship  #significance 

#Worker - Enters into a paid employment out of his/her own will, is not in a managerial job, has contractual relations with the employer
Worker /= Labour; 
#Labour lacks choice for any reason, are forced into work, are in feudal / ritual relations with the employer. #Eg Child labour, bonded labour
Work > Employment (more narrow)
#Robert #Blauner Increase in use of technology leads to higher degree of alienation
#Frank Hull also echoes similar views, the relation is more negatively linear than curvilinear
Work > employment
As tech pervades workplace, nature of work also changes. #Eg E-commerce, virtual workplaces, cowork spaces, etc

## Social Organisation of Work
***

#Organisation of Work - Patterning of activities which involves a technical & social component  #defn 
Technically - Division of Labour #DoL 
Socially - reflects normative structure of Society in the form of #stratified order

Different societies have difference organisation of work at different times
#Marx #Capitalism was offing in Europe, South Asia had Asiatic Mode of Production #MoP  

### General Schema - Dimensions of analysis of organisation of work ~ Ideal Typical Framework
1. Production Activities - Hunting-gathering, mass #production, #agriculture
2. Nature of Work - Simple/Complex, Formal/Informal
3. Source of #Power - #Land, capital. Classical #Elites - Power in individual qualities, #Marx - Power is in control of modes of production #MoP 
4. #Stratification System - Result of pattern of inequalities. Master-slave, Lord-Serf
5. Social #Mobility - High-low, Ascriptive-acquired
6. Degree of #Alienation - #Marx Peaks in Capitalism, #Weber Result of increasing rationalisation of work
7. Specific #features - Gender roles, Age roles, Individualisation, Communal organisation
8. Misc - #Power relations, Social #Mobility , #Alienation , #Religion Outlook, Value system, Community feeling, #kinship groups, etc

### Primitive Slave Societies
Man was overwhelmed by forces of nature, like rains, floods, which determined the social organisation. Forces of production were at lowest level and material density was low. Family was self-sufficient unit of production & consumption
- 2 Classes 
	- Masters - Owners of mode of production #MoP  & Slaves
	- Slaves - often Prisoners of War

> [!quote] Class Struggle - #Marx 
> "The class struggle is the motor of history"

#### Features
1. Major Economic Activity - #Hunting & Food gathering
2. Ancient Mode of Production #MoP  - Few mastered the skills of hunting and enslaved others
3. Low division of labour #DoL 
4. No specialised economic organisation - Occupational differentiation limited to birth, sex, age
5. Little/No #Surplus - Poor specialisation so Low productivity
6. Low/Simple #Stratification - because Inequalities are low
7. No private ownership
8. Religion dominates and interferes in Economic life
9. Low level of Innovation - Simple needs
10. Family role in production - Community based production
11. #Power Source - Animated - human labour, animal power
12. Low level of #Alienation - Workers enjoy fruits of their production
13. Simple economic system - No distinction between domestic & community economy  #features #characteristics 

### Feudal Agrarian Society
Agriculture became a dominant, Land got slowly privatised, though ownership was largely communal. Exchange of commodity was rudimentary
##### Relationships based on
1. Domination
2. Subjection 
3. Exploitation

#### Features
1. Major economic activity - #Agriculture
2. Feudalistic mode of production #MoP  - based on Control over Land
3. Enhanced Division of Labour #DoL  - 3 #estates
	1. Nobility
	2. Clergy
	3. Serfs
4. Little #Surplus - Markets start emerging
5. Low Social #Mobility - Closed society, #ascriptive in nature; Role of estates defined by birth
6. Low #Alienation - More autonomy & lesser specialisation, absence of strict organisation of work
7. #Religion dominant in workplace, family & Life
8. #Family plays an important role in production  #features 

### Modern Capitalist / Industrial Society
Production increased, Surplus-trade - increased, usage of mechanical instruments increased, new markets emerged. Industries/Factories were setup.
Man now controlled Nature. With emergence of industries, family loses its place as primary production unit
- #Marx - Exploitation of Workers by Capitalists + Alienation
- #ED - Complex #DoL > Increased #Organic #Solidarity > High Social #Cohesion


> [!quote] Exploitation - Engels
>"The exploitation of labor is the root of all social problems." - Friedrich Engels

> [!quote] Alienation - #Marx 
> "Alienation is the experience of being disconnected from one's work, oneself, and others"

#### Features
1. Major economic activity - Mass production in factories
2. Complex division of labour #DoL  - specialisation increases
3. Centrality of Capital - Factory production - More importance to Capital, less to labour 
4. Production for exchange & profit - Earlier it was for self-consumption. #Marx - Earlier goods had `use value`, now they have `exchange value`
5. Production based on Competition & not cooperation - Demand increased
6. High Alienation - Workers lose control over the produce & monotony of work is very high
7. Multiplicity of economic institutions - New services are needed, so new institutions like factories, bank, markets emerge
8. High #Surplus as production is not for self consumption
9. Money Economy - Money replaces barter system, labour is commoditised
10. Use of Inanimate #Power - Leads to higher production & less human involvement
11. High Occupational Mobility - Due to increased means of communication
12. Work Life Separation - Domestic & Commercial activities are separated as community production replaced by factories
13. High Levels of Innovation - Individual has more freedom to be creative
14. Secular Economic Settings - Work organised more rationally, not on customs. Laws are progressive and Religion plays lesser role  #characteristics 

##### Ways of Organisation of Work in different societies
1. Developed Countries - Generally industrialised and service oriented
2. Developing Countries - Still largely engaged in Agricultural services ( #IndianSociety needs to get out of Feudal mode for development)

##### Other Factors affecting Work 
1. Social Organisations also depend on Cultural Factors. #Eg #PESC #Weber 
2. Political Systems also affect works. #Eg Rapid Industrialisation in Japan after Meiji Revolution 
3. Geographical Factors - #Eg #IndianSociety Northeast Tribal way of work different from Delhi-Bangalore metros  #factors

Harry #Braverman - Work in capitalist orgs is exploitative & alienating, workers are coerced into servitude in a factory system (Critical analysis of scientific management at workplace from #Marxist #perspective)

Organisation of Work in modern post-industrial societies cannot be clubbed under any single classification. Diverse service industry, increasing entrepreneurship, automation, inter-disciplinary working, specialisation, etc have opened many new areas of study  #conclusion 

### Post Industrial Society
Post-industrial society is a society that has transitioned from an economy based on the production of goods to an economy based on the provision of services. Transition is accompanied by a shift in the workforce, with more people employed in the service sector and fewer people employed in the manufacturing sector

#### Features - Key Characteristics
1. Knowledge Economy - Ideas + Information underpin the economic growth
2. Based on
	1. High #Technology
	2. #Education & Training
	3. #R&D in life sciences, technical field
	4. Growth of #Finance & innovation
3. Major #Workforce engaged in
	1. Design & Development
	2. Technology & Marketing 
	3. Sales - Service
	4. NOT in Manufacturing sector
4. Fundamental Traits
	1. Service based economy
	2. Highly educated workforce
	3. Focus on R&D

##### Positive Outcomes
1. Improved Quality of Life - Higher standards of living, due to
	1. Higher Incomes
	2. Better Healthcare
	3. More Leisure time
2. Educated Population - More people are attending colleges & pursuing higher education
3. Increased Economic Growth - because service sector is more productive than manufacturing sector

##### Negative Effects
1. Increased Inequality - Gap between rich & poor widens, as this type of society is highly rewarding for skilled workers and not for unskilled workers
2. Deindustrialization - Decline in manufacturing sector leads to job losses in industrial cities, which in turn leads to economic hardships and social problems
3. Environmental Problems - Problems of Pollution & Climate change due to the resource intensive nature of service sector

Overall, the transition to a post-industrial society has been a positive development for many countries. However, it has also created some challenges that will need to be addressed in the future  #conclusion 

## Relation between Work & Economy
***

### Social Determinants of Economic Development
Uneven economic development of various societies prove that economic development depends on various Social factors. #Weber proves this relation in Protestant Ethics & Spirit of Capitalism #PESC 
#Goldthorpe - #Middle #Class is not only about Wealth, but also about values & lifestyle  #socialclasses 

#### Social Factors affecting Economic Development
1. Education System
2. Religious beliefs #PESC 
3. Social #Stratification - #Caste, #Class, #Gender
4. Personal values - Ascetism, hard work, enterprising
5. Demographic composition & Dependency ratio
6. Scientific advancement
7. Spread & penetration of Money economy
8. #Urbanisation level
9. #Secularisation  #factors 

##### Lack of Economic development in Indian Society due to
1. #Caste system rendered society fragmented
2. Worldly Ascetism - Religious practices Islam Hinduism 
3. Joint #family system focussed on affective aspects & less on liberal enterprising values
4. Lack of Political Unity in post Mughal period  #IndianSociety #IS

### Industrialisation & Social Change
#Industrialisation - Shift from animate (humans/animals) to inanimate (coal, electricity) source of power, Rise of factories & use of machinery in production of goods
This phase was termed as Industrial Revolution #IR by Arnold #Toynbee   #defn 
Overall transformation of some societies & so some regions emerged more prosperous than others, `Skewed Prosperity!`

#### Social Changes due to IR
1. Occupational Shifts - Agriculture to Industry
2. Achievement based Division of Labour - Communal & family #DoL gave way to Scientific Division of Labour
3. High DoL & Opportunity for #Mobility - Increased stratification/specialisation
4. Changing Power Relations - Decline of estates and rise of Capitalism. Land no longer remained central, industry & trade emerged as new sources of power
5. New forms of #Conflicts - Trade unionism, #Labour #mobilisation - New modes of class struggle
6. Demand for Skilled Jobs & Educational Changes - Education as #agent of Social change & facilitator of skill development
7. Changing Family Structure - Mobile & Nuclear family
8. Revolution & Marxian Thoughts - Industrialisation & Capitalism lead to real change - arrival of #Socialism
9. Misc. - More Jobs, more prosperity, better standard of life. Communication & production process became more efficient  #SC #changes 

Sociologists study the relationship between work and the economy in order to understand how it shapes our lives and society  #conclusion 

## Formal & Informal Work in Society
***

#Amitai Etzioni - Our society is an organisational society
Organisations are social units with specific objective & goals to achieve unlike family, friends, kinships
Rise in #DoL -> Rise in various types of organisations. Political, economic, etc functions are now performed by distinctive organisations

### Formal Organisation of Work
Worker is governed by formal rules & regulations which are defined by a formal contract or by government legislations, statutes & rules  #defn 
Formal Organisations are rationally designed #Eg #Bureaucracy , have explicit objectives and also defined means' Formal #authority structure is also present which tries to balance the rights of all stakeholders

#### Characteristics
1. Legal status
2. High #DoL
3. Permanent Work
4. Primacy of structure
5. Rules & Regulations  #characteristics 

### Informal Organisation of Work ~ Unorganised sector
Workers are governed by directions (often whims & fancies) of employer, rules are implied rather than stated, escaped legislations of the land/government, develops based on the personal linkages, prone to exploitation & low social security  #defn 
#ILO IO characterised as consisting of units engaged in the production of G&S with the primary objective of generating employment and income to the persons concerned, this sector consists of a range of vulnerabilities & deficits in decent work
Beyond the workplace, informal organisations can be viewed as an amalgamation of a set of personal relationships, social #networks, communities of common interest like #caste, creed based, & even as an #emotional sources of motivation

#### Characteristics (Keith #Hart coined the term IO)
1. Low skilled
2. Easy entry
3. Low paid employment
4. Lacks social security
5. (primarily) Immigrant Labour  #characteristics 

At #macro level - Work is informally organised in traditional societies and formally in modern societies. But Formal & Informal organisations cannot be strictly separated from each other
Informal relations exist at all levels, even in modern orgs, especially at the Top
Peter #Blau Informal structures exists even in formal organisations
#Meyer & #Rowan Formal rules and practices are often quite distant from the practices actually adopted by the members of the organisation

#### 4 Theoretical Strands explaining existence of Informal Sector
1. Dualist School - Informal sector comprises of only a few marginal activities. Informal workers are excluded from modern economic activities
	1. Imbalance between population & economic growth rate
	2. Mismatch between peoples skills & structure of modern economic opportunities
2. Structuralist School - Views informal sector as subordinated economic activity. It is an essential feature of a Globalised free market system
3. Legalist School - Informal sector is made up of small entrepreneurs who choose to operate informally to avoid costs and registration
4. Voluntarist School - Informal entrepreneurs deliberately seek to avoid regulations & taxation but do not blame Bureaucratic process, but do so based on cost-benefit analysis 

##### Informal in Formal
Organisation of Work depends on the task to be accomplished. #Eg Mission mode tasks require informal mode as it provides flexibility
Ad-hoc committees in formal organisations also work in informal ways
###### IOs in FOs have their own limitations
  1.  Some individuals may usurp power and promote vested interests
  2. Undermine the main goals and principals of organisation
  3. Ill consequences - Corporate scams, insider trading, collusive bribery  #limitations 

### Labour & Society
> [!quote] Labour - Adam Smith
> "Labor is the source of all wealth"

Labour is a old concept but in modern sense it arrived with the growth of Capitalism. 
Worker (has a choice) /= Labour (without choice, due to lack of work or social exploitation)
Labour lacks choice due to lack of alternate work or Social #exploitation

#### Labour classification
1. Industrial #Labour
2. Child L
3. Agriculture L
4. Rural L
5. Feminine Labour
6. Formal / Informal L  #classification

#### Characteristics of Labour 
1. Marketing of human labour in Industrial societies
2. High division
3. Workspaces shifted from home to workplaces
4. Labour is sold in market and not necessarily be of domestic nature

#### Labour - Society & Karl Marx
Labour is a process in which both man and nature participate, man starts regulating & controlling the material reaction between himself and nature. (Here L is not limited to only economic activities but all productive actions that transform material aspects of nature with our purpose)
Objectification of Human purpose - Labour is peculiar to human beings only as animals cannot produce. Labour creates something in reality that previously existed only in human imagination
Labour is material, as it works with more material aspects of nature
Labour is the development of human powers -  potentials. It satisfies needs & create new ones
Labour is a social activity, it transforms the society
Labour in capitalism is not owned by workers!
Workers are forced to sell their labour time to capitalists for survival
#Hegel viewed L in non material terms, in form of idea - Mental labour

- KM eye for #Labour 
	1. Labour - Elementary Factors 
		- Work itself
		- Work subject
		- Work instruments
	2. L Power - Aggregate of Mental + Physical capabilities of a human

Harry #Braverman - Fordism & automation led to Deskilling of labour force. L lost control over its skills due to specialised production as they learn only a small part of the process thus becoming more dependent on capitalist system
Michael #Burawoy rejects Marxian idea - Labour Unions have challenged the arbitrary power of management

Robert #Blauner #Technology & #Alienation - Different forms of tech provide different attitudes to Worker, so varying degree of alienation

#ED #DoL is a process of evolutions in society and leads to interdependency which integrates the modern society. In Industrial society, mechanical solidarity is poor, so labour relations & interdependency creates new forms of integration

##### Fordism & Taylorism
High #DoL in factory and workplaces, suitable for mass production. Work process is standardised, more defined, less flexible
Post #Fordism Era - Focus is on customised production, so more flexibility & differentiation of work
#Critic - Post Fordism - #Neo Fordism - It is not complete transformation but exaggerated that mass production is replaced by flexible production

##### Feminist perspective - Labour in society in terms of Female participation
Ann #Oakley Industrialisation confined women at home, forced to take role of housewife.
Women participation is increasing but there is Occupational Segregation
House work has become invisible, as real work is the one which brings direct wages
Men leave workplace at the end of day, so there is clear work-leisure divide, not the same in case of females
Paid work brings in money which brings power divide and creates inequality, women are dependent on men for their own and family survival

- Feminization of Labour - Increasing participation of women in labour force
	1. Reasons - Labour shortage due to WW1, decreased birth rate, mechanisation of domestic tasks, personal desire, economic pressure to sustain
	2. Changes in Domestic DoL - Male breadwinner model broke, Women mainly responsible for Care stereotypes broken

Arlie #Hochsild Service industry requires manipulation of emotions. So labour is not just physical labour
#Marxist - Commodification of labour power
Decline of trade-union movements have eroded the bargaining power of labour in modern world. Flexible production, liberal labour laws, intense global competition have also eroded the bargaining power

#Handy Flexible Labour as now multiple skills are required, Portfolio Workers have a multiple skill portfolio instead of a single specialisation
Use of IT and tech has increased control and regulation at workplace, making work more mechanical

Globalisation of Labour in post modern times - High mobility, trans-boundary movements, competition leads to cheaper production, degradation of labour

- Gender Inequalities at work
	1. Occupational Segregation - Masculine & Feminine Work #Eg 5Cs - Clean, cater, care, cashier, clerical
	2. Concentration in part-time work - to balance W and family obligations
	3. Wage Gap - Poor rewards, informal work

Rise of service sector due to decline of older factory production
Blue Collar manufacturing to White Collar Service
Technological Determinist - +ve advocates of Tech
