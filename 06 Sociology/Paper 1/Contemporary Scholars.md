Here is a list of contemporary sociologists who are making significant contributions to the field:

These sociologists are working in a variety of areas, including economic sociology, social theory, cultural sociology, and the sociology of science. Their work is helping to shape our understanding of the social world and its many complexities.

Here is a brief overview of the work of some of these sociologists:

1. Omar Lizardo is known for his work on the micro foundations of social structure. He has argued that social structure is not simply a collection of individuals, but rather emerges from the interactions of individuals.
