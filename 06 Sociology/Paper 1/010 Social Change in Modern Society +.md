#### Concepts related to Social Change

Social Change #SC Wilbert #Moore - Significant alteration in structure over time in behaviour patterns & culture, including norms & values

##### SC Aspects / Facets Views
1. #Structural Changes - Affects the whole society fundamentally. #Eg Industrialisation, Urbanisation, Democratisation, GR, Legal rights, occupational mobility
2. #Cultural Changes - Changes rooted in value-belief system. #Eg Women empowerment, caste dilutions, changes in family forms, Sanskritization, #GT #LT, Westernisation

##### SC Characteristics
1. Value Neutral (Neither good nor bad)
2. Varies in Speed & Scope

##### Sources / Causes of SC 
1. Economical
2. Political
3. Technological
4. Cultural
5. Environmental

##### Sources of SC based on origin 
1. Endogenetic
2. Exogenetic / Equigenetic

#SC is a complex process, it is important to understand the factors that can lead to it so as to be prepared for the challenges & opportunities that lie ahead  #conclusion 

## Sociological Theories of Social Change
***

#### Sociological Theories of SC - classified based on how Change is viewed
1. Linear Model of Change
2. Cyclical
3. Wave
4. Growth & Decay
5. Spiral
6. Ever expanding
7. *Post modernist* - No fixed pattern for SC  #classification 

### Linear / Evolutionary Theories
Adapted from the Biological evolution theory. #Comte #Tylor #Spencer #Marx #ED #Tonnies
- Change is gradual - from Simple to Complex form

1. #Comte used Progressive Evolutionary Model for new forms of Society in Law of 3 Stages. 
	- Intellectual development as the basis of all development. 
	- Law of 3 Stages - 
	  1. #Theological - Society is an expression of Gods will. Thinking based on religious ideas and beliefs
	  2. #Metaphysical - Started with #Renaissance Society is seen in natural terms. Imaginative thoughts questioned theological dogmas. These are periods of Stability and upheaval known as Organic & Critical Periods. CP inaugurates new phases
	  3. Positivistic - Starts with new scientific discoveries
	    1. Eventually, man would be able to measure empirically and explain conclusively, all forms of social behaviour
	    2. Aspects of #SC - Social Statics remain constant, Social Dynamics change
2. #Morgan Moral stages of society - Primitive - Barbaric - Civilised stages of development
3. #Tylor Evolutionary sequence followed 3 stages - Animism - Polytheism - Monotheism. Principal criteria for cultural growth were growth of industrial arts, scientific knowledge, nature of socio-political organisations
4. #ED Evolutionary typology of SC - Society evolves from highly UNdifferentiated (mechanical-simple society) to Highly Differentiated (Organic-complex)
5. LT #Hobhouse SC based on Human Development
	- 5 Stages of Human Society Development
		1. Preliterate
		2. Literacy & Proto Science
		3. Reflective Thought
		4. Critical Thought
		5. Modern Science
6. #Spencer Social Darwinist - Idea of survival of the fittest. Evolution is a twin process of Differentiation & Integration from simple things to complex. Reality is governed by Cosmic Law
	1. Stages of Evolution of societies - Simple - Compound - Doubly compound - Trebly Compound
	2. Theory of Evolution from Militant Societies (involved in warfare) to Industrial Societies (based on friendship, altruism, elaborate specialisation, recognition for achievements)
	3. *Comte* focussed on larger units like family, Spencer on individual. #Comte evolution is in realm of ideas, Intellectual development, while Spencer is in real material world.

### Cyclical Theories of SC

### Structure Functionalist Theory of SC of Parsons
Concept of Dynamic/moving Equilibrium - Change is seen progressing from a stage of moving equilibrium to another

#Parsons takes a systems view of society, where equilibrium is a dynamic
1. Flux in the external situation tends to throw system off balance
2. Processes inside the system are going on providing impulse for change
Thus the equilibrium is distributed & system again restores it making it a dynamic equilibriums. Change is a temporary state which is overcome by systematic forces. Change occurs when structural strain of a system exceeds equilibrium forces. When shared values are institutionalised in a system, it results into an equilibrium state.

#### 2 Integral Aspects of Parsons Idea of Change
1. Systems View of Change - Change is restorative bringing system back to equilibrium. All the structures are closely related to each other & the functions are interrelated & interdependent. It is related to Parsons #AGIL framework, any disturbance in energy flow or information flow leads to SC. Since system is integrated, change in any of the functional pre-requisite produces change in others also
2. Evolutionary View of Social Change - Societies head from one Evolutionary Universal to another in 5 stages. History of human society from hunting-gathering to complex is seen in terms of increasing adaptive capacity of society. As society evolves from simple to complex, control over environment increases, posing a problem of integration. This problem is solved by generalisation of values. Social Integration & Social Order are maintained by Generalisation. SC involved process of increasing differentiation, specialisation, adaptation
- Systems & Subsystems - SS changes, so other SS adjust, thus overall System changed to a new one


### Post Modernist Perspective  on SC
#PM characterized by a rejection of grand narratives, a scepticism of metanarratives, with a focus on the local and the particular
Post Modernist #PM see SC beyond integrating-conflict debate, rejecting the grand theories of SC as proposed by #Marx #ED #Parsons 
#SC not driven by any single factor, but rather by a complex interplay of forces. Reject the idea that SC is always progressive, pointing to the ways in which it can also lead to fragmentation and inequality

##### Features of PM on SC
1. **Rejects grand narratives:** World is too complex and constantly changing to be understood in terms of a single, unified narrative
2. **Focuses on the local and the specific:** Best way to understand the world is to study it in its particularity, rather than trying to fit it into a pre-defined framework
3. **Emphasizes the role of power:** Power relations shape our understanding of the world
4. **Rejects the idea of progress:** SC can also lead to fragmentation & inequality
5. **Emphasizes difference:** Postmodernists argue that there is no single, universal truth. Believe that there are multiple truths, each of which is valid from a particular perspective
6. **Challenges traditional notions of social justice:** Notions are often based on a false universalism  

#### Key features of the postmodern perspective on SC
1. **Rejects grand narratives:** Postmodernists reject the idea that there are any overarching theories that can explain the course of history. They argue that the world is too complex and constantly changing to be understood in terms of a single, unified narrative
2. **Focuses on the local and the specific:** Postmodernists focus on the local and the specific, rather than on the global or the universal. They argue that the best way to understand the world is to study it in its particularity, rather than trying to fit it into a pre-defined framework
3. **Emphasizes the role of power:** Postmodernists argue that power relations shape our understanding of the world. They believe that the way we see the world is not simply a matter of individual perception, but is also influenced by the power relations that exist within society
4. **Rejects the idea of progress:** Postmodernists reject the idea that social change is always progressive. They argue that social change can also lead to fragmentation and inequality
5. **Emphasizes difference:** Postmodernists argue that there is no single, universal truth. They believe that there are multiple truths, each of which is valid from a particular perspective
6. **Challenges traditional notions of social justice:** Postmodernists have challenged traditional notions of social justice. They argue that these notions are often based on a false universalism  #features   #rephrase  #left 

#### Feminist Perspective
Emphasises centrality of gender in SC. Social Reality is viewed differently by both the sexes
Rising awareness of rights, #feminisation of workforce, women #movements , challenging #gender stereotypes, changing social attitudes, are seen as new dimensions of #SC 

##### Feminist Movement roles in bringing SC
1. Feminist movement against domestic violence has led to increased awareness of the issue and to changes in laws and policies  #Eg 
2. Feminist movement for economic equality has led to increased opportunities for women in the workplace and to changes in laws and policies governing pay equity

Feminist perspectives continue to play an important role in the fight for #SC By challenging gender inequality & working to create a more just equitable society, feminists are helping to make the world a better place for all women  #conclusion 

#### Post Structuralism
PS characterized by a focus on language, meaning & relationship between the signifier and the signified
Jacques #Derrida & Michael #Foucault analysed the emergence of modern institutions like prisons, schools, hospitals as a sign of increasing surveillance & discipline in society
Postmodern society is likely to be more multi-cultural & diverse, leading the traditional sociology to be insufficient to account for SC
Jean #Baudrillard Mass media has reversed the Marxist idea of Economic structure domination, rather signs & images control the society which is a creation of mass media

#Postmodern perspective on #SC is still evolving, it is not clear what its full implications will be. However, it is clear that the postmodern perspective has had a significant impact on how we think about SC  #conclusion

## Agents of Social Change
***
#left #Remaining 
Agents of social change are the people, groups, or institutions that initiate or facilitate social change. Agents of social change can be motivated by a variety of factors, such as a desire to improve society, to challenge the status quo, or to promote their own interests

### Factors of Social Change - Classification
1. Cultural - Culture is a system that constantly loses & gains components by way of Invention of ideas, Discovery of meanings, Diffusion to larger public. #Eg Recent changes in the gender rules #Women #Empowement  Change in values, norms, belief
2. Ideas & Values - Influx of new ideas & modification of older ones brings wide scale #SC #Eg #Weber #PESC 
3. Social Structure - #Marx Tensions & Conflicts between the haves & have nots results in revolution and communism to bring in a socialist society
4. Political Factors - Ruling #Class usually defines the political setup and channelises resources accordingly #Eg Military Dictatorship, #Democracy , Universal Adult Franchise. Government policies, rise & fall of political movements, outbreak of War
5. Environmental & Physical - Early civilisations flourished on riverbanks. Natural disasters, depletion of social resources, Global Warming & Climate Change also brings multitude of #SC 
6. Economic - #Marx True #SC in form of Communist Revolution by change in Economic structure. #Eg #Globalisation #Capitalism Changes in the distribution of wealth, economic development, rate of economic growth
7. Demographic - #SC emanates from Demographic Transition in society, Migration, death & birth rate change, population size, age structure & distribution
8. Religious Factors - Religion brings change & also resists change #Eg #PESC Neo-Marxist - #Religion has dual roles, #Gramsci Cultural & Counter hegemony
9. Technological - #IR lead to social upheaval. #Ogburn Cultural #Lag also mentions technology as an important factor for SC
10. Conflict & Change - SC is caused by tension & conflict. Structural strain, deprivation, cultural revitalisation, etc have been major causes of conflict. Social Divisions based on caste, creed, ethnicity, gender, etc are also sources of conflict & change
11. Social #Movements - Organised efforts of a group of people to bring about deliberate change in the values, norms, institutions, culture & traditions. Generates new identities & new perspectives
12. Education - Increases the capacity to absorb new ideas
13. Legal Factors - #Eg Constitution of India abolished Untouchability. `Important feature of Modern World` 

- Civil Rights Movement 
- Womens Right Movement -  women now have the right to vote, the right to own property, and the right to equal pay for equal work  #left 


## Education & Social Change
***

#left #rephrase 
  
Education can be a powerful force for social change, as it can help to create a more informed and engaged citizenry, and it can also help to break down social barriers. Conversely, social change can also lead to changes in education, as new needs and demands emerge.

#ED argued that education is essential for social integration, as it helps to transmit shared values and norms from one generation to the next. 
#Parsons saw education as an important mechanism for social reproduction, as it helps to maintain the existing social order. 
#Paulo Freire argued that education can also be a force for social transformation, as it can help to empower people to challenge the status quo.

In recent years, there has been growing interest in the role of education in promoting social change. For example, education has been seen as a key tool for reducing poverty, promoting gender equality, and preventing conflict. There is also growing evidence that education can help to improve health outcomes, increase economic productivity, and strengthen democracy.

While education is not a magic bullet, it is clear that it can play a significant role in promoting social change. By providing people with the knowledge, skills, and values they need to participate in society, education can help to create a more just and equitable world.

Here are some specific examples of how education has been used to promote social change:

- In India, the Right to Education Act has helped to increase access to education for millions of children from poor families.
- In South Africa, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission used education to promote understanding and reconciliation between different racial groups.
- In the United States, the Civil Rights Movement used education to challenge segregation and discrimination.

These are just a few examples of how education can be used to promote social change. As we continue to face global challenges such as poverty, inequality, and climate change, education will become even more important as a tool for creating a better future.



## Science, Technology & Social Change
***
#SnT are essential ingredients of modern life, accompany us from cradle to grave, an important secular medium which transcends local boundaries & touches everyone's lives
Evolution of mankind can also be seen in terms of Technological Evolution
Historical epochs and civilisations can be seen in terms of technological advancement #Eg #IR #GR #Technology 

Science, technology, and social change are all interrelated. Science provides the knowledge and understanding that drives technological innovation, while technology can have a profound impact on society, both positive and negative. Social change can also influence the development of science and technology, as new social needs and demands can lead to new areas of research and development.

One of the most significant ways in which science and technology have influenced social change is through the #IR . The development of new machines and power sources led to a dramatic shift in the way people worked and lived. The industrial revolution also led to the rise of new social classes, as well as new forms of social organization.

Science and technology have also played a role in advancing social changes related to healthcare, transportation, and the environment. #Eg development of new vaccines and antibiotics has helped to improve public health, while the development of new transportation technologies has made it easier for people to travel and communicate. The development of new environmental technologies has helped to reduce pollution and protect the planet.

Of course, science and technology can also have n`negative impacts` on society. #Eg development of nuclear weapons has the potential to destroy the world, while the development of new technologies can lead to job losses and economic instability. It is important to be aware of the potential risks and benefits of science and technology, and to use them in a responsible way.

### Similar technologies have different impact on different societies
1. Development of the printing press in 15thC led to the spread of knowledge & information, helped to fuel the #Renaissance and the #Protestant Reformation
2. Development of the steam engine in 18thC led to the #IR , which transformed the way people lived and worked
3. The development of the automobile in the early 20th century led to a dramatic increase in mobility, which had a profound impact on society
4. Internet in the late 20th century has led to a revolution in communication and information sharing, which is still ongoing

#rephrase #Remaining #left Rephrase the entire topic in short

- **Karl Marx** argued that technology is a product of the material conditions of society, and that it plays a significant role in shaping social relations. He believed that the development of new technologies can lead to social change, as it can create new forms of production and distribution, which in turn can lead to changes in the way people live and work.
- **Max Weber** also saw technology as a product of social relations, but he argued that it can also have a more independent influence on society. He believed that technology can lead to rationalization, which is the process of making social institutions and processes more efficient and calculating. This can lead to changes in the way people think and behave, as well as in the way society is structured.
- **Talcott Parsons** argued that science and technology are essential for social progress. He believed that they provide the knowledge and tools that are needed to solve the problems that societies face. He also argued that science and technology can help to create a more just and equitable society.
- **Ulrich Beck** argued that the development of new technologies, such as nuclear weapons and genetic engineering, has created a new kind of social risk, which he called "manufactured uncertainty." He believed that these risks are so great that they can no longer be managed by traditional institutions, such as the state or the market. This has led to a new form of social organization, which he called "reflexive modernization."
- **W.F. Ogburn:** Ogburn argued that technology and social change are related in a cyclical fashion. He called this the "cultural lag" theory. He argued that technology changes more rapidly than society, which leads to a "lag" between the two. This lag can create problems, such as social unrest and inequality. For example, the development of the automobile led to a change in the way people traveled. This change in turn led to changes in the way people lived and worked.
- **Thomas Kuhn:** Kuhn argued that science is not a linear process of discovery, but rather a series of paradigm shifts. A paradigm is a shared set of beliefs and assumptions about the world. When a new paradigm emerges, it challenges the old paradigm and leads to a period of social and intellectual upheaval. For example, the development of the theory of relativity challenged the old Newtonian paradigm of physics.

The relationship between science, technology, and social change is complex and ever-changing. It is a relationship that is worth studying, as it can help us to understand the past, the present, and the future  #conclusion 

It is a complex and ever-evolving topic, & there is no single answer to the question of how these forces interact. However, the work of these thinkers has helped to understand the ways in which science, technology, and social change can shape each other, & how they can all play a role in the development of human society  #conclusion
