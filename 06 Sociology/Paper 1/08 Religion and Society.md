# Unit 8 Religion & Society
***
Sociologist try to understand Religion in the form of an institution. Consider it as a Collective Human Activity & not as a supernatural thing. Study relationship of Religion with other social institutions 
- Functionalist - <ins>Beneficial entity</ins>
- Conflict Theorist - Device of the haves to ideologically subdue the have-nots
Earlier it was a speculative activity, but now Religion is seen in terms of functions - dysfunctions & present forms

Religion - A Cultural system of commonly shred beliefs & rituals that provide a sense of ultimate meaning & purpose by creating an idea of reality that is sacred, super natural & all encompassing
#ED Religion - A unified system of beliefs & practices related to sacred things, that is to say that things set apart & forbidden, beliefs & practices which unite them into a single moral community for all those who adhere to them. Religion is about the realm of sacred. (Elementary form of Religion)


- It is important to remember that religion is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon. There is no single definition of religion that is universally accepted, and there is no single way to study religion. The best way to understand religion is to learn about different religious traditions and to talk to people who have different religious beliefs.

New Definition of Religion, that transcends the dualism of materialism-spiritualism, sacred/secular
Peter #Mandaville & #Paul James Religion - A relatively-bound system of beliefs, symbols & practices that addresses the nature of existence, and in which, communion with others & otherness is lived as if both, takes in & spiritually transcends, socially-grounded ontologies of time, space, embodiment & knowing

## Sociological Theories of Religion

#Remaining 







## Types of Religious Practices 

++ Animatism #Remaining 
++ Bongaism

### Animism ~ Ancestor Worship
Belief in Anima/Spirits, world is driven by (Benign/Malevolent) spirits
Man finds the presence of spirits in objects or notions that surrounds him
Most primitive idea that gave birth to religion, as a religious concept it is associated with primitive people
#Eg Teton Sioux, America Ghost Dance to appease spirits; Evans #Pritchard Nuer, North Sudan Sky Spirit/High Ghost, #IndianSociety Witchcraft, Sorcery, Pitra & Shradha among Hindus - rituals & prayers to placate souls of ancestors
Religions with an idea of Transmigration of Soul as a central tenet also have an idea of Anima inherent in it
Edward #Tylor in Primitive Culture developed distinction between magic, religion & science. Associates Animism to primitive societies & transforms into modern religion as society evolves. Any type of spiritual phenomena, souls, divinities, which are animated & interpreted by man, explain the stage of Animism





#### Emerged from 2 Questions
1. What is the difference between a Living Body & Dead?
2. What are the Humans shapes that appear in Dreams & Visions?




### Monism & Pluralism

Monism - Belief in a single attribute, God or a religious idea. Belief of Oneness of all existence in a single God/ideology. Coined by Christian #Wolf 
#Eg Advaita Philosophy in Hinduism (no distinction between disciple & God, everything is 1 in existence), Thales, Plotinus, Adi Shankara
#Eg #Islam is a modern Monistic religion, stressing on the single all powerful entity Allah
EB #Tylor Evolutionary Theory of Religion, Monotheistic Religions are hallmark of Modern societies & Pluralistic Religion of Primitive Societies
Monistic Religions are symbols of nascent religions, as sects-cults emerge from original, it transforms into Pluralistic Religion
Pantheism - Belief that all of reality is identical with divinity & everything composes an all encompassing God, do not believe in distinct personal or anthromorphic God
Popular #Western Religious ideology, Baruch #Spinoza 17th Century, opposed #Descarte Mind-Body Dualism

Pluralism - Respecting others as other, accommodate different viewpoints, beliefs, Counter to Exclusivism ideology
Syncretism - Mixing of different beliefs into one single output
Syncretism /= Pluralism

## Fundamentalism & Communalism

- Definitions
	- Fundamentalism - A call to return to the fundamentals of faith. Strict adherence to a set of principle with antagonism to other viewpoints
	- Religious Revivalism - Mass movements based on intense R upheaval. Periodic RR seeks to restore commitment & attachment to R. It is a regular sociological feature of Religious tradition. Revival of R in any form be it institutional attendance, growth of r institutions, Fundamentalism, rise of sects-cults, etc
	- Communalism -  #Remaining 


### Fundamentalism & Religious Revivalism 

Access to the exact meaning is limited to the privileged few, thus providing them with enormous authority and power #Eg Priests and clergy class
Forces of drastic social change are important for the emergence of F and it is erected as a defence against new forces of change, modernity and globalisation
Chaos emerges when there is loss of identity and rootlessness among people, F then provides certitude and restitution of an earlier golden age

#### Distinct features of fundamentalism
1. F stresses on the infallibility of scriptures, accepting it as a literal historical record and God's own words as unambiguous and changeless #Eg Bible, Gita, Granths
2. All aspects of life are to be governed by the religion as found in central texts and scriptures
3. Propagate for the religious control over education and go against the separation of religion from politics
4. Do not believe in equality of other religions
5. Opposed to reason, rationality, humanism, secularism
6. Reject all corrupt lifestyles, F movements are not only religious but also for lifestyle #Eg Maududi - Ignorant Muslims, Bhindranwala - Fallen Sikhs Swami Dayanand - corrupt lifestyles
7. TN #Madan F movements are of collective nature. Often led by charismatic Male leaders #Eg Khomeini of Iran, Bhindranwala for Sikhs

Historical Christian and Muslim power struggles, rise of Islamic fundamentalism in recent times, American aggressions in Iraq, Modernisations etc have led to the reform movements to restore lost glory
Gabriel #Almond Religious groups in various countries due to various reasons are moving towards fundamentalism
Recent election victories of Right wing groups in various countries is also seen as rise of fundamentalist forces
Sometimes they resort to violence #Eg rise of ISIS a global fundamentalist outfit

#### Factors for rise of Fundamentalism #Bruce 
1. F is for restoration of traditional beliefs because of destruction by modernisation and secularisation
2. Religions with a single text offers ideological cohesion to mobilise people with common beliefs, so less fundamentalism
3. Threat perception or presence of a common enemy #Eg Jews after Holocaust
4. F requires potential charismatic recruiters #Eg Baghdadi for ISIS
5. Wider political support #Eg Buddhists in Myanmar against Rohingya
6. Presence of a Centralised religious authority #Eg Khomeini in Iran
7. Relative deprivation especially by Modernisation
	Gabriel #Almond Structural factors
	1. Unemployment
	2. Radical Social Change
	3. specific historical chance
	4. presence of prosecuted ethnic groups
	   #Eg Iranian Revolution, 1979 as a reaction to US interferences

RR

#Comte Classical evolutionary predicted that in scientific stage, Science will replace Religion
During Renaissance, religion saw a decline in terms of institutional attendance and beliefs due to scientific temperament. But recent years, revival of religion takes place, showing that religion has not declined

Re-emphasis on role of religion, at different levels
1. Increased institutional acceptance of religion - Attendance + Construction of new religious places #Eg BAPS Temples in almost 100 countries, increasing activities of sects and cults - ISKCON
2. Increasing use of religion as a medium - Religion becomes tool for resistance against exploitation. Political parties use religious support to ascend to power #Eg BJP in India, Erdogan in Turkiye
3. Growth of Invisible / Private religion - #Luckmann R today is invisible as individuals carry it out in their private space and not in institutions
4. Growth of Civil religion - Robert #Bellah - Civic Religion - Civic symbols and nationalism are accorded same respect as faith in religion

Due to stress, anomie, alienation people want to experience peace in spirituality. Religion has also rationalised itself and focus on moral guidance instead of strict adherence to customs. Increasing communal clashes in West Asia. All these indicates rise in religious fervour

Religion has survived because of the individual & social functions it performs. 
#Turner , Secret of R survival is - R is not a cognitive system, set of dogmas alone, it is a meaningful experience


### Fundamentalism & Communalism
- Common Ideological elements
	1. Both attack concept of separation of Religion from Politics & State
	2. Oppose concept of equal truth in all Religions & Unity of different religions
	3. Advocate control over education by the followers of the dominant religion

Fundamentalism - Strict adherence to the Religious Doctrine & full opposition of other religions and any Criticism
Strict adherence to a set of principles with antagonism to other view points

Karen #Armstrong - Fundamentalism is a part of Modern scene. They believe that they are fighting for survival as they believe the Western Secular Values aim to wipe out their Religion completely
Steve #Bruce echoes similar views


\# | Fundamentalism | Communalism
------------ | ------------ | -------
1 | Stresses upon infallibility of scriptures | Strong allegiance to ones own ethnic group rather than society. Can be based upon religion, race, ethnicity
2 | Pursuit of Political power is important | More protective of its own rights & beliefs, exclusionary in nature
3 | Tend to separate certain communities from mainstream | Religion based opposition. Ideological & activates during social upheaval
4 | Aims to establish a normative order by various means, Wars to speeches | Establish Supremacy through hatred & Violence
5 | As a movement is led by Charismatic leaders | Have a mass psyche, may not form a sustained movement
6 | Reject all corrupt lifestyles & aim to get rid of such evils from society | No such reformative agenda
7 | Opposed to Rationalism & Discard equality of all Religions | Nothing as such during peaceful times
8 | Are usually Reactive in nature & a response to what they consider as a Crisis | Usually emerge when conflicts of interest & sense of insecurity arises
9 | Promotion of the Original | Antagonism is central here


1. Communalism is often associated with eruption of violence & riots which may or may not have any particular goals
2. In a multi-religious society, Fundamentalists tend to be communal, but not the other way round. #Eg RSS, ML, Akali Dal were communal parties but not fundamentalist
3. Communist leaders may not be Religious leaders. #Eg Maulana Maududi of Jamat Islami - Journalist, Hedgewar of RSS - Physician
4. Fundamentalists want only 1 religion, while Communalist only want to communalise their own social community
5. Communalists needs a Binary Opposition (real or created) to mobilise its members
