## Lineage & Descent
***
Individual is a member of family and also other kin groups based upon a system of Rituals & Obligations

### Lineage - Kula (Unilineal Descent Group)
Understood in 2 terms 
1. Principle - Alignment or Inheritance is chosen in a linear fashion, called line, lineage, Vanshvali. Gives rise to descent group, linear in character. Common forms - #Patrilienage #Matrilineage
2. Type of Kin group - Kula, members have a common ancestor whose identity is known and can be traced back, generally considered as the founder of the group. 

### Descent - Vansha
Principle - Person is socially affiliated with the groups of his/her parents, grandparents, so on. Individual can belong to simultaneous multiple groups like, 2 parents, 4 grandparents, 8 great grandparents. Restrictions are placed to limit the size of descent groups, or else everyone in the world connects to a single descent group. A common ancestor or a mythological figure or a symbol can be the cut-off point. Different principles may be used in different societies to limit the recognition of descent group on the basis of a common identity 

Transmission of Descent group membership from parents to children
1. Unilineal - Through a single line adn is pre-defined. Followed in most parts of India. Further it has 2 classifications
	1. Patrilineal - descent is traced in the male line from the father to son
	2. Matrilineal - traced in female line from mother to daughter
2. Double - Duolineal Bilineal - Descent is traced in both, fathers and mothers line for different attributes, like movable property in one line and immovable property in the other line
3. Ambilineal - Cognatic - Affiliates an individual to the kinsmen either through the fathers line or mothers line. Individual is free to choose the side. #Eg Samoans of South Pacific 
4. Parallel Descent - Very rare form, Descent lines are sex specific. Men transmit to their sons, women to daughters
5. Cross Alternative type Descent - Very rare, Men to daughters and women to sons

#### Descent groups
Family is the smallest dg. 
Family < Lineage (common linking ancestor known) < Clan Gotra (common linking ancestor not known) < Phratory ~Indian Caste (common mythical ancestor)

Descent Group Functions
1. Perform Rituals on occasions like birth, marriage, death
2. L&D instrumental in defining identity of person & distinguish between insiders and outsiders
3. Evans #Pritchard Kinship groups convert into War Groups in ancient times
4. Built in authority structure, power exercised by senior males
5. Rules of Inheritance are formed and exercised
6. Individuals economic rights & responsibilites will be defined by the position in descent groups. 
7. Property Rights are well-defined amongst the kingroups
8. (Esp Unilineal) Jural Units internally decide their own disputes & externally act as unified group for conduct of feuds and fights
	1. For this reason, Lineage Structure is often co-terminus with Politics in societies lacking a centralised state structure

## Contemporary Trends
***
Contemporary changes viewed in terms of
1. Changing structure
2. Functions of Kinship groups and patterns of relationship between them
Changes brought by
1. Newly emerging Bureaucratic organisations
2. Individualisation
3. Migration
4. Education
5. Nuclearisation
6. Arrival of Modern Contraceptive Methods
	1. Limited size of family
	2. Improved choice of women, thus giving more freedom to women
	3. Induced Psychological and Behavioural issues among family members as individualism grew with small family size

Structural terms
1. Nuclear family
2. Decline of patriarchal relations
3. Weaning authority of parents over children
4. Rise of alternative kinship institutions like Live-ins

Functional aspects
1. Functions of family are taken away by alternative institutions
	1. Judicial Function of Kin groups
	2. Education by schools and universities
	3. Placement function by economic organisations 

Cases of marital breakdown, divorce and separation are increasing. Incidences of domestic violence also. Community & Kinship Bonds are weakening, lesser avenues to vent out frustration leads to distress in marital life, leading to breakdowns

Marital Breakdowns
1. Divorce - Legal termination of marriage
2. Separation - Physical separation without legal recognition 
3. Empty Shell Marriage - Merely reside together with no shared bond or attachment 

Factors for rise in marital breakdown in post-industrial society
1. Easy to get divorced due to Legislative reforms and uniform civil code 
2. Nicky #Hart Opportunities to escape marriage are more, Divorce is no more a social stigma
3. #Fletcher Over expectations & more demands from marriage leads to breakdown
4. William #Goode Social units become relatively fragile, as nuclear families carry heavier emotional burden
5. #Goode argues tat as a result of relative isolation of the nuclear family from the wider kinship network family carries a heavier emotional burden and as a consequence this unit is relatively fragile. In an industrial society, family performs fewer functions and as a result there are fewer bonds to unite
6. Marriage is no longer a sacrament, as life is becoming more secular 

#Goode If spouses are from different social - ethnic backgrounds, chances of divorce are increased, as reinforcing mechanisms are weak. Wifes are expected to perform traditional role and also encouraged to work, thus giving a double burden, leading to conflict

Instances of marital breakdown are culture and context specific. Nicky #Hart Inverse relation between Income and breakdowns. Status of parents also affect married life of children. Children of divorced parents have a higher chances of getting divorced. #Hart Experience of having divorced parents reduces aversion to divorce. T #Noble Divorce rate is more in certain occupations, actors, authors, lorry drivers

Implications are manifested in terms of impact on family, kin and society. George #Brown It is one of the most stressful moments of ones life. 
Single Parenthood is on the rise and Family as a social institution is threatened. 
Divorce leads to separate homes and doubling of resource requirements. 
Marital Breakdowns create a general feeling that integration of society as a whole is affected. But welfare measures like family allowances, old age pensions, health security, helped family in tiding over the challenges posed by forces of change.

**Contemporary Trends in Systems Kinship**

Kinship, the social network of relatives, is undergoing a dynamic transformation in the modern world. While traditional kinship systems emphasized blood ties, marriage, and co-residence, contemporary trends are leading to a more fluid, diverse, and inclusive understanding of kinship.

**1. Declining Importance of Traditional Kinship Structures**

- **Nuclearization of Families:** The prevalence of nuclear families, consisting of parents and their children, has increased, leading to a reduced role of extended kin in everyday life. Sociologist Talcott Parsons (1955) observed this shift, noting the functional significance of nuclear families in modern societies.
    
- **Individualization and Reduced Kinship Ties:** Individualization, the emphasis on personal autonomy and choice, has led to a weakening of traditional kinship obligations and expectations. Sociologist Anthony Giddens (1991) termed this phenomenon "reflexive modernization," suggesting that individuals actively construct their own identities and relationships.
    

**2. Diversification of Kinship Forms**

- **Chosen Families and Fictive Kin:** Individuals are increasingly creating their own kinship networks, forming close bonds with friends, neighbors, and others who may not be related by blood or marriage. Sociologist Judith Stacey (1997) coined the term "chosen families" to describe these voluntary kinship ties.
    
- **Transnational Kinship:** Migration and globalization have led to the formation of transnational kinship networks, connecting families across borders. Sociologist Saskia Sassen (1998) highlighted the role of transnational kinship in maintaining cultural ties and providing support for migrants.
    
- **Blended Families:** Remarriages and cohabitation have resulted in the emergence of blended families, creating new kinship dynamics and challenges. Sociologist Arlie Hochschild (2001) conceptualized "stepmothering" as a complex role that requires emotional labor and negotiation.
    

**3. Redefinition of Kinship Roles and Relationships**

- **Evolving Gender Roles:** Traditional gender roles within kinship structures are being challenged, with women assuming greater roles in economic and decision-making spheres. Sociologist Arlie Hochschild and Anne Machung (1989) introduced the concept of the "second shift" to describe the unequal division of domestic labor between men and women.
    
- **Changing Patterns of Caregiving:** Kinship networks continue to play a significant role in providing care for children, the elderly, and the disabled, but the forms and responsibilities of caregiving are evolving. Sociologist Margaret Stacey (1996) explored the changing dynamics of caregiving within families, emphasizing the role of gender and intergenerational relationships.
    

**4. Impact of Technology on Kinship**

- **Social Media and Virtual Connections:** Social media platforms have facilitated communication and connection among kin members, especially those geographically dispersed. Sociologist Barry Wellman (2002) introduced the concept of "networked individualism" to describe the interplay of personal networks and individual autonomy in the digital age.
    
- **Technological Mediated Kinship:** Technology has transformed the way we maintain kinship relationships, but it also raises concerns about the nature and quality of these connections. Sociologist Sherry Turkle (2011) cautioned against the potential for technology to replace face-to-face interactions and diminish emotional intimacy.
    

**Conclusion**

Kinship, though adapting to contemporary trends, remains a fundamental aspect of human society, shaping individuals' identities, social connections, and well-being. Understanding the evolving nature of kinship is crucial for social scientists, policymakers, and individuals alike to navigate the complexities of modern families and kinship networks.

## William Goode  - Role Bargaining
Like Parsons, William Goode argues that industrialisation tends to undermine the  
extended family and larger kinship groupings. However, Goode does not regard the  
pressures of industrialisation as the only reason for the breakdown of extended family  
ties as nuclear family is found in many areas where the rate of industrialisation is slight  
Goode believes that the ideology of nuclear family has encouraged its growth,  
particularly in non-western societies. This is partly due to prestige of western ideas  
and lifestyles. He also argues that the spread of the nuclear family is due in part to  
the freedom it affords its members.  
Applying the concept of role bargaining, Goode concludes that extended kinship ties  
are retained in industrial society if individuals feel they have more to gain than to lose  
by maintaining them. The extended family patterns are most likely to occur in the  
upper classes. Since the members of ruling classes and elites have an important  
influence on appointment to top jobs, the retention of family makes economic sense.  
In Goode’s terms it is an effective role bargain.
