## William Goode  - Role Bargaining
Like Parsons, William Goode argues that industrialisation tends to undermine the  
extended family and larger kinship groupings. However, Goode does not regard the  
pressures of industrialisation as the only reason for the breakdown of extended family  
ties as nuclear family is found in many areas where the rate of industrialisation is slight  
Goode believes that the ideology of nuclear family has encouraged its growth,  
particularly in non-western societies. This is partly due to prestige of western ideas  
and lifestyles. He also argues that the spread of the nuclear family is due in part to  
the freedom it affords its members.  
Applying the concept of role bargaining, Goode concludes that extended kinship ties  
are retained in industrial society if individuals feel they have more to gain than to lose  
by maintaining them. The extended family patterns are most likely to occur in the  
upper classes. Since the members of ruling classes and elites have an important  
influence on appointment to top jobs, the retention of family makes economic sense.  
In Goodeâ€™s terms it is an effective role bargain.
