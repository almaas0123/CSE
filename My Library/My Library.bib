“Introduction” (“Test Sample”, p. 7)
“• Country’s population makes up the building blocks of the nation. Human hands and human brain are the most effective instruments to shape the future of the nation. In 21st century India will bless with the largest youngest population of the world. To convert them into human capital would be a great challenge and great opportunity before policy makers. • Having limited natural resources to support world’s second largest population, it makes mandatory to study the population profile of India. • According to Census 2011 the population of India was 1.21 billion. India occupies 2.4 \% of the land area of the world but it is the home of 17.5\% of the world's population. •” (“Test Sample”, p. 7)

“• {GDP} increase : According to a 2018 report by the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations every 10\% increase in India’s internet traffic delivers a 3.1\% increase in per-capita gross domestic product. • Economic growth : Digital revolution has brought economic growth, job creation and human development at a faster rate. While the Industrial Revolution was a marathon run, the digital revolution is turning out to be a sprint. • Human Productivity : {ICT} would boost the economy through increasing productivity gains only if people having access to the technology also have the requisite skills for making optimal use of it. • Digital ecosystem can improve productivity of farmers by providing them with processed data on soil, weather, storage, logistics and digital land records that enable them to avail credit and access crop insurance. • Tele-services : Improved digital ecosystems can help with the expansion of telemedicine , tele-education that can reduce the shortage of medical professionals in rural areas and smaller towns. E.g. During Covid-19 pandemic, both telemedicine , tele-education played a huge role in advising patients online and online education. •” (“Test Sample”, p. 13)

“• Inclusive Cities: In cities, the poor and lower-income groups must be integrated into the mainstream. o The planning should take into account the needs of the marginalised groups, such as housing, health, water, transportation, and other services at reasonable pricing. • Urban Governance: India's city governance needs to be overhauled. Large cities throughout the world have empowered mayors with long terms and clear accountability for the city's success, in contrast to India's current urban governance. • Integration: To establish sustainable cities or metropolitan regions, integrate multiple urban development and related programmes at the municipal, state, and national levels. • Devolution must be accompanied by greater reforms in urban finance, which will lessen cities' reliance on the federal government and states while also releasing internal revenue streams. • India must make urban planning a central, recognised function by investing in talented people, a rigorous fact foundation, and innovative urban design. o This can be accomplished through a "cascaded" planning structure in which large cities have metropolitan-level 40-year and 20-year plans that connect municipal development plans. • Affordable housing is a significant concern for low-income populations, and in the absence of a feasible model that meets their needs, India can tackle the problem by enacting a series of regulations and incentives that would bridge the price-affordability gap. •” (“Test Sample”, p. 121)

“Conclusions ● Since the middle of the twentieth century, India has witnessed a rise in average temperature; a decrease in monsoon precipitation; a rise in extreme temperature and rainfall events, droughts, and sea levels; and an increase in the intensity of severe cyclones, alongside other changes in the monsoon system. There is compelling scientific evidence that human activities have influenced these changes in regional climate. ● Human-induced climate change is expected to continue apace during the twenty-first century. To improve the accuracy of future climate projections, particularly in the context of regional forecasts, it is essential to develop strategic approaches for improving the knowledge of Earth system processes, and to continue enhancing observation systems and climate models.” (“Test Sample”, p. 190)

“Aptitude is the combination of abilities and other characteristics, whether innate or acquired, known to be indicative of an individual’s ability to develop proficiency in a particular area. • Let us also differentiate between ‘aptitude’ and ‘skills’. The latter is something that is acquired and constantly upgraded by training and reading of relevant material, whereas the former is something that is already there and can be nurtured. • In simple terms, aptitude is like a raw material that is present. Now it is up to the individual to acquire the relevant skill set to process this raw material and make a finished product that can be used for a defined objective or purpose. • Lastly, aptitude also reflects on the future potential of an individual.” (“{GS} 4 Ethics”, p. 20)

“India was under colonial occupation till 1947. The colonial authorities had designed the governance structures to not bring about accountability and make it democratic but to control and enhance control over the citizens. • Their three stated objectives were: revenue maximization, maintenance of law and order and protection of the frontiers. • They enacted strict legislations such as the Official Secrets Act, 1923 to prevent the flow of information to the people and this ensured that the people were only subjects of governance and could actually never participate in the governance process. • In recent times, the Government of India has enacted provisions such as the Right to Information Act, 2015 and the National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy, 2012 to usher in transparency and provide for good governance. • Good governance is the hallmark of a responsible government.” (“{GS} 4 Ethics”, p. 29)
“There is no standard definition of transparency around the world. The 2nd Administrative Reforms Commission defined this term as: “availability of information to the general public and the clarity about the functioning of the government”.” (“{GS} 4 Ethics”, p. 29)
“This mere access to information is futile if there are no mechanisms to address the grievances pertaining to it. There will have to be inbuilt mechanisms to address the citizen’s grievances to make it more transparent.” (“{GS} 4 Ethics”, p. 29)
“Access to information also enables accountability of the government to the citizens. It reduces corruption, inefficiency etc.” (“{GS} 4 Ethics”, p. 29)
“The important principle of information sharing is that the information belongs to the public and the owners have a right to access it, make copies of it and use it in a manner that will be empowering.” (“{GS} 4 Ethics”, p. 30)

“Probity means goodness and instilling a sense of discipline in both private as well as public lives of individuals. In the field of governance, it would translate into having transparency in policies and actions and a strong ethical system and institutions and adhering to them” (“{GS} 4 Ethics”, p. 34)
“It includes honesty, integrity, incorruptibility and transparency amongst others. • The principles aren’t sufficient by itself. It needs an institution to implement it in a proper manner, so as to gain the trust of the citizens.” (“{GS} 4 Ethics”, p. 34)
“For example: India has strong laws against corruption. But do the institutions implement it?” (“{GS} 4 Ethics”, p. 34)
“Some of the attributes of probity in Governance, as elucidated by the Nolan Committee report in the {UK} include:” (“{GS} 4 Ethics”, p. 34)

“sponsors” (“{GS} 4 Ethics”, p. 35)
“In addition, the 2nd Administrative Reforms Commission recommended the inclusion of the following acts under the Prevention of Corruption Act, thus bringing it within the ambit of the definition of corruption: • Acts that subvert the working of the constitution and the democratic institutions by violating the oath of office, • Abuse of authority by favouring someone or harming the other, • Obstruction of Justice and • Squandering of public money” (“{GS} 4 Ethics”, p. 35)
“There is a popular saying that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely” (“{GS} 4 Ethics”, p. 36)
“On top of this food chain are the government servants, not just officers but also small-time staff. They all yield varying amounts of power and access to public finance. This allows them to determine the future of the citizens. This is where corruption starts.” (“{GS} 4 Ethics”, p. 36)
“There is a lack of incentive for people to be honest as they don’t see acts of corruption being punished.” (“{GS} 4 Ethics”, p. 36)
